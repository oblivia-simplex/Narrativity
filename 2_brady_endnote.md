| *Dear Editor,*
|
| *Once upon a time, you could drive through the city stoned and create
| a makeshift eclogue out of that fuzz of vague participation, much as
| earlier drivers had created their pastoral investments with property
| in rolling parkland. In the windows which were not plywood painted to
| resemble glass, but behind which were walls painted to resemble
| all-encompassing skies, people would perform the parlor drama of
| their social obligation to your passing. Going through someone\'s
| trash, or the stack of papers on someone\'s desk, or the pages
| inserted by a printer\'s error into someone\'s typescript, was a hot
| and dirty intimacy. The substance of a whole affair might take root
| in a similar sense of euphemism.*
