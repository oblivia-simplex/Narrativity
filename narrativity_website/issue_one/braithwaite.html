  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> ...as a child I was told 

    that not knowing the alphabet will cause illiteracy. It'll send you into a 

    drugged out gangland life of white trash nightmares and corner boy peddling 

    to homosexuals, who are professional players, obsessed with age and are willing 

    to drag it and you into emptiness. That in knowing the letters, I’ll know 

    that they assemble to construct various images that become words. Words are 

    the narrative transformation of the images. Printing a page of unbroken words 

    is like a fresh tattoo. It captures a moment/place, sentiment and period. 

    It orchestrates the body in motion as it flexes to move a pen/strike at a 

    key/form a fist/lift a drink or move to a rhythm. The words become the unspoken 

    intertextuality of ethnic, racial and cultural metaphoric speech. The metre 

    of casual dialogue = a rhythm/noise/visual/bass, a soundtrack to a post-literate 

    train of thought. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> I dedicated <b>Wigger</b> 
    to the sound of Slayer and Sonic Youth&#151;&quot;Bloodland&quot; to Cannibal 
    Corpse (George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher) = I dedicated them to sound. 
    Slayer is for the fury and speed and violence that the book has. Deathmetal 
    is the living desire of the neo-redneck burnout. It's all going after the 
    sport of brutality&#151;the art of hurting someone. The walking jokes, with 
    targets on their backs, placed there by lil’bitches, ‘taking them for M’n 
    M’s. The only violence is, the way the words appear on the page, marked by 
    the slashes that connote rhythm of speech and interrupted thought. They are 
    like semi-colons = / the // are colons and so are the = signs. Sometimes the 
    - move out to separate speech&#151;someone takes lead//does a solo. Sonic 
    Youth's sounds appear in the form of the book dissolving. Deathmetal is just 
    dealing with the situation. The book and the story, like the characters, are 
    trying to hold themselves together. Brian and Jerehmia symbolize this the 
    most. They talk. No one listens. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">...a printer ejects swatches 

    of stolen tissue that collects the sound and images of what is considered 

    low brow art and skill// </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Brian appears to be rambling 
    but he makes the most sense because he speaks through metaphor and his heart, 
    like Black speech and song&#151;the negro spiritual, seeming to sing about 
    a river, </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">enterprise. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Brian’s grasp on reality 

    becomes inconsequential. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Jerehmia’s story is dumbshow. 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Brian surrenders his 

    ideals and his soul, by killing Spook (the Black hustler friend). </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Jerehmia is just having 
    his taken and he's telling you about it&#151;but I knew people in Atlanta 
    that didn't want to hear about any of that or them. I knew a boy from Tennessee 
    hurting worst than what was going as oppression under those 100 dollar Afro 
    centric hats. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">...Wordcore, Jamaican 

    dub poetry, Rap and Rock Steady are disposed to the Homeric boasts and catalogues 

    of post-modern thugs/hoodlums and desperadoes w/ the hope of kindness and 

    compassion. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> In donning the Black 
    persona, symbolized through the silver jacket, Brian finally does what everyone 
    has been attempting to do throughout the book. Brian is killed&#151;his soul 
    is killed, through the burden of the weight of the Black youth&#151;the Black 
    persona, the persona of deglamoured oppression. He has achieved the goal of 
    being Black but he is unprepared to handle something that the Blacks are raised 
    to deal with through centuries of struggle&#151;you’d suppose. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I met a boy with crystal 

    smack grey eyes, who was offering to suck the fender (for $5) off an urban 

    assault vehicle for a painkiller. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If you listen and see 

    the page, you'll see a tattoo and note well, that some words are// </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> -Rhythm </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> -Lead and </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> -Bass </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Jerehmia, he has no desire 

    to be Black. He knows what the shit is and he's got his own. He just watches 

    the seemingly liberal Perry go catch back the Black boy trying to bail on 

    the whole scene. He just knows that nothing that's happening, is about him 

    or the niglet. It's about the little men with big shirts and the chicks in 

    bed or sitting off from the Bar b q.. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">...strange how all the 

    youngmen holding up walls waiting on passers by had deep drawls, no smiles 

    and trailers in their hearts. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> The book and the story 
    are collapsing. The spaces and sparsness of the narrative is there to get 
    you to listen carefully and read again and close read and not take things 
    at face value. People say more, especially, when they've had a lifetime of 
    hurt, through very few words and the words look in ways that they feel&#151;speeching 
    in accapella. The words sound the way they feel. The book shows patterns of 
    speech. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Mcluhan would argue the 
    global village: technology is good&#151;the book people are lacking in the 
    rich grammar of the TV = This is referred to today as the post-literate generation&#151;John 
    Cage’s bastard children turn to violence and the acoustic space of video and 
    computer games and the delicacy of words typed over television screens. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mcluhan would argue... 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">...the acoustic </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2 . </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> The Comic book uses frames 
    and juxtaposition to connect the disconnectedness of thought and words, be 
    it through the gruff noireness of Frank Miller, Dave Sim or Martin Wales’ 
    &quot;Kinder Nacht,&quot; or the smooth lines, colours and ruff justice of 
    Todd McFarlane. They collect the street sounds and activities the way Rap 
    culture manipulates and emulates, via spin art and samples, the ready made 
    terror of interurban life. To frame is to make perfect the moment of the fingers 
    striking the keys, which can be the repetition of words and phrases = outlets 
    ripping and shredding, w/ the knowledge that framing is certainly an attempt 
    to make perfect, to make the words as enticing and elegant as the bovine euphony 
    of a fascist's goose step. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Brian is condemned to 
    sit, numbed out on pills, in a room, filled with drag queens, watching them 
    transform. Just like Brian's desire, and the other characters desires, to 
    be Black, the drag queens attempt to be women, without knowing, that beyond 
    the glamour, is a lot of hardship and struggle. Drag queens die, as well, 
    when they finally achieve their dream of being a woman. It's not as much fun 
    or better than they thought it would be. They are unprepared for the daily 
    struggle and threats. You can see this on the page. They are boxed in, allowing 
    themselves to be, finally, separated from the freeness and flow of the book. 
    They must stay within the parameters. The glamour is gone. They have to bear 
    the actual pain. Brian has got the auditory recollection of rape in his head. 
    Brian is numb. So’s Jerehmia, but he's numb from the beginning, any way. He’s 
    just recollecting, now&#151;no need to figure. He can’t hold it together, 
    nor does he want to. His flag is upside down, Oswald’s dead&#151;nothings 
    right. You separate the body from the mind and it’s all good. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> ...a word can be the 
    hums or bops in the background as when a funk musician beats the strings w/ 
    his thumb&#151;the buzz and scratch of a tat gun on a steadied arm or back&#151;the 
    stilled breath and firm muscle of a word or image engraved on a belly. It 
    gets tied into the paragraph. Some words take on the repetitive ecstatic riff 
    of ska or reggae or the decay of the crash/noise of H.C. or metal. They recline 
    on the page or in the air as if they were all going to amount to a junkie’s 
    last sigh. Instead, they collapse into the lost, disorientated and somewhat 
    satisfied image of Orsen Wells after thrashing a room at Xanadu. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> ...and the book and story 
    crumble into a final sustained note, done through a note to Andrew from Jerry. 
    &quot;Bloodland&quot; has a crack of gun shot and shit and a heart beat. As 
    it began on a note&#151;it ends. His (Jerry’s) speech is proper and distant 
    from the language of the book. He has become a literary character of the Modernist 
    sense. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Jerking the Modernist 
    approach to distance, into &quot;groovy times,&#148; is the dumbshow to the 
    contemporary adoration of the absurdist tragic comedy = anti-romantic. It 
    presents itself, today, through the jaded situationism of talkshow culture. 
    The sort that &quot;Blast&quot; and &quot;Counter Blast&quot; utilized through 
    the headlines and print of newspapers. The newspapers place horror and glory 
    side by side in a folio that has a calculated randomness. It will always assemble 
    to state 1 thing = these events happen. It is only through such genres of 
    media (music/comic/print/television), that we can see that each has a thing 
    in common/coupons and advertising = rhetoric and metaphor. If the passage 
    of a text takes on the sound and image of the disjointedneness of casual speech 
    and media, then the results are not only the coded tales being woven, but 
    the presentation of the brutality that leads to the violent outcome. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Jerehmia, he just figures...he’s 

    just feedback from a bass, right now. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>Wigger</b> and &quot;Bloodland&quot; 
    are what the printer jetted out&#151;a conceptual pastiche alphabet from the 
    corner or gutter. It assembles the images in sequence which persuades the 
    narrative to be pulled out from under a character. It’s what got them blocked 
    off&#151;formatted, layed out, then pile-drived with carefully selected skin 
    grafts of onomatopoeias. The words takes Auden’s diver, diving w/ his ‘brilliant 
    bow’ and takes it beyond the enthralled spectator. They suppose that he has 
    forgotten to test the water and has come out a dumb struck paraplegic = what 
    just happened/where are our people/who are our people/do we have any people: 
    NO. However, they still keep tabs on the moment, place sound and period that 
    left the object devastated, hung over, and w/ an image permanently scratched 
    and coloured onto his flesh or hanging in a window.-- </font></p>
