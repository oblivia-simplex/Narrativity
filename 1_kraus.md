# Chris Kraus: Hunger -- Technology -- Emotion




From my LA diary ---


Los Angeles, sometime in the late 90s ---


My heart and stomach flip while waiting in the endless gourmet
take-out line at Say Cheese on Hyperion. This is the third full day
not eating .... I stare through thick plate-glass at tureens of baby
peas in mayonnaise. Ten bucks a quarter pound, they're canned. Little
bits of foreign cheese displayed on the top shelf like so many sad
specimens. English tilton, camembert. From the bodies of imprisoned
animals to the air-conditioned case, it's obvious this food was never
touched with love or understanding. The chubby woman up ahead of me
seems to think this food is good. She is luxuriating in the moment
when she speaks her choices to the shop girl, even though the girl is
bored and hardly even listening. I'd hoped to trick myself to eat by
ordering the most exquisite food but now this place offends me. Say
Cheese, Say Choose. She wraps the names of foods around her tongue,
pleased with her passable pronunciation. Why do I hate everything? The
food here is so vastly overpriced, it no longer smells like food, it
smells like bills and coins and plastic.


If I'm not touched it becomes impossible to eat. It's only after
sex, sometimes, that I can eat a little. When I'm not touched my skin
feels like the flip side of a magnet.


The Alien penetrated me very slowly as we sat together on the bed.
(This is Ulrike Meinhof speaking to the inhabitants of Earth ....As
the rope was tightening around my neck I lost perception but regained
all my consciousness and discernment. An Alien made love with me ...)
Uncovering his body takes my breath away. The paleness of it
underneath the soft dark hair. The Alien was naked. I had several of
my clothes on. We're very still. Fibrational quivers between our
bodies in the dark. "This's exactly how I imagined it would be. So
smooth." It now becomes possible to say anything. Low voice. "Don't
move." "I like to hear your breathing."


Like me, the Alien is anorexic. Sometimes we talk about our
malabsorption problems. Everything turns to shit. Food's
uncontrollable. If only it were possible to circumvent the throat, the
stomach and the small intestine and digest food just by seeing. After
several weeks the Alien decides that he will no longer make love to me
because I'm "not the One." Aliens spend their lifetimes on this
planet testing, searching. They get dewy-eyed, nostalgic about
hometown virgins.


I'm in my kitchen making chicken noodle soup for the Alien. It's his
fifth day of withdrawal from valium and heroin. He can't walk, can't
sleep. I want so much for him to eat. Even though he says he doesn't
love me, I can't believe it's true. Therefore, I want to help him.
"How about a nice piece of wholewheat toast?" I ask, ladling out his
soup. "Don't take offense by this," he says, "but there's
something I have to tell you. Your cunt smells bad. If you washed the
way you should, I would've done the things to you I do to all my
other girlfriends." I gasp. Soup spills. "Sorry," he says. "I
guess I should've mentioned it when we were dating."


Food stripped of all its color, nutrients and smells and then
reconstituted, like my expensive hair (he loves it), Ravissant Salon,
$300, like suburban small town cunts drenched in Massengil.


If I could only eat, a little ---


Although no one, to my knowledge, has analyzed the work of Frederich
Nietzsche through the occurrence of his blinding headaches, the poet
Kenneth Rexroth reads Simone Weil's philosophy through her anorexia.
Both are "egregious nonsense ... unholy folly." Rexroth puts lays
the blame where it belongs; on the Catholic men, Gustave Thibon and
Father Perrin, who took her seriously. "If only," Rexroth speculated
in **The Nation** (1957), "she had sought out an unsophisticated
parish priest, who would have told her 'Come, come, my child, what
you need is to get baptized, obey the Ten Commandments, forget about
religion, put some meat on your bones and get a husband' ..."


What you need is a good fuck, he said to me.


In **Holy Anorexia**, the scholar Rudolph Bell wants to take the
magnificence of the medieval female saints and drag them down to his
own level. He does this by conflating them with contemporary teenage
girls, who he finds pathetic and ridiculous. St. Catherine, St.
Theresa, and Hildegaard van Bingham are all essentially the same;
they're solipsistic brats. The collective trans-historic She, the
holy anorexic, "emerges from a frightened insecure psychic world to
become a champion of spiritual perfection .... Her will is to do
God's will, and she alone claims to know God's will." The holy
anorexic is a manipulative vixen; she "commands the war against her
body and therefore suffers deeply at every defeat, whether it is a
plate of food she gobbles down or a disturbing flagellation by nude
devils and wild beasts. Then with varying degrees of success, the holy
radical"---like the newly slender teenage girl---"begins to feel
victorious ..."


Like witches, or female writers, thinkers, artists, who use the names
of others when chronicling their lived experience, holy anorexics are
not merely people to be differed with; they must be despised.


Shouldn't it be possible to leave the body? Is it wrong to even try?
Hungry yet repelled by food, Weil wrote: "Our greatest affliction is
that looking and eating are two different operations. Eternal
beatitude is a state where to look is to eat."


"The Alien is in my eyes. He's flooding my eyes. He's completely
penetrating me, every bit of me in my eyes.


He's in my eyes, he's spreading into my brain. Oh God,


he's in my mind. He's making me feel things in my body that I don't
feel. He's making me feel feelings, sexual


feelings. And he's there. He's everywhere. My body's changing."

In **Aliens & Anorexia** I am attempting to make contact with the
writer and philosopher Simone Weil. At the moment of her death in
August, 1943, Weil became an Alien, i.e., a legend who transformed
politics into tragic poetry. Not all Alien encounters are hostile and
dispassionate invasions. There are others who see the Aliens as their
friends. Aliens encounters, like narrative, happen essentially in
realtime. In order to make contact with the Aliens, it is necessary to
carve out little pieces of yourself to let the Aliens come in.


In Paris, the librarian Florence de Lussy is editing Weil's
**Collected Works** for Gallimard. Weil's been dead for more than
fifty years. The project's overdue. The edition will contain eleven
volumes, and yet hardly any of what Weil wrote was published in her
own lifetime. Because she was an amateur philosopher, teaching
philosophy in French girls' lycees until 1941 when Jews were banned
from working for the government, Weil's writing has a narrative
quality mostly absent from the philosophy of her own time. She wrote
articles for the leftist press, reports, position papers and
communiques during her years as a trade union activist. Concurrently,
and in the years following her disillusion with the trade union
movement, she wrote notebooks and voluminous letters to her friends
and colleagues. In solidarity with the dispossession of the workers
who her labor colleagues claimed to represent, Weil sought out the
experience of dispossession in the person that she knew the best,
herself. "If the 'I' is the only thing we truly own, we must
destroy it," she wrote in **Gravity and Grace**. "Use the 'I' to
break down 'I'." She was despicable; according to Bataille,
"odious, immoral ... a dirty hook-nosed Jew." Had anyone taken her
seriously enough to prompt her to write professionally for
publication, her work would not have happened. She was writing to find
out what she thought.


"The body is a lever for salvation," Weil wrote in her notebook in
New York. "But in what way? What is the right way to use it?"


Simone Weil was a performative philosopher. Because her texts are
really notebook writings, there isn't ever any subject that's apart
from her. Which is not to say she's writing "memoir" or
"autobiography." Channeling her subjects through her person, Weil
does what writers do. She is constructing a narrative in
realtime---arriving at a state of openness, witnessed by her audience,
the reader---in which thoughts fly in and out according to who's
listening. In Weil's philosophy, just like in narrative or phone sex,
it's not the story that we're really hearing, it is the fact and act
of telling it. Her thought approaches narrative---an emotional
transparency that occurs when someone else is listening to you.
