| Chunky on the shag rug\                                               |
| I\'m looking for my anthem\                                           |
| I\'m looking for my headphones\                                       |
| I\'m looking for the bare spot\                                       |
| On the rug to wallow side-\                                           |
| Stepped on the chair-stopped\                                         |
| Door, and as I blast my ears\                                         |
| Out with *A Night at the Opera,*\                                     |
| I\'m looking at pictures of you\                                      |
| My catholic princes, my mother\                                       |
| Father proxy, I\'m in London\                                         |
| With you now, the koi pond, the flamingo,\                            |
| The statues, the hymnal,\                                             |
| The Aretha Franklin song at the funeral,\                             |
| Alone on a pew, watching the water,\                                  |
| Watching the bare spot on the rug\                                    |
| Filled with pictures on the floor,\                                   |
| I\'m ignoring the knocks on the door\                                 |
| I\'m ignoring the knocks on the door\                                 |
| Stepped and stripped on the chair-\                                   |
| Stopped door, I\'m listening, listening.                              |
|                                                                       |
