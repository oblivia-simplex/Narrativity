**These are the names** of places, of cities, of climates that make
characters. The clear mornings, a fine rain fallen for twenty-four
hours, rare images originating in America and elsewhere, two natural
disasters that oblige us to stick together in the midst of cadavers,
these are the gestures quiet or purple, the shells, the icicles in
the happy hour glasses, crockery noises or a light stuttering that
torments an instant, a slap, a kiss these are the names of cities
like Venice or Reading, Tongue and Pueblo, the names of characters
Fabrice, Laure or Emma. The words sharpened over the years and the
novels, words one spoke while breathing badly, while laughing, while
spitting, while sucking an olive, the verbs we add to the lips'
pleasure, to success, to a certain death. These are words like knee
or cheek or still others stretching as far as the eye can see making
us lean over the void, stretch like cats in the morning these are the
words that make one stay awake till dawn or take a taxi on week
nights when the city falls asleep before midnight and solitude sticks
in our jaws like an abscess. These are words spoken from memory, from
want or from pride, very often words pronounced with love while
placing hands on nape of neck or filling a glass of port. These are
words whose etymology must be sought, that must then be plastered to
what's called a wall of sound, in a manner like those who cry out in
pain and sigh with pleasure that wander in dreams and documents
assault the heart's mysterious obscurity. These are words like bay,
hill, wadi, via, street[^2_brossard_*] stasse dispersed through the dictionary
between flame-trees and neons, cemeteries, dismal and forests. These
are words sound the body of meanings that are claws or soft[^2_brossard_*] on our
chests, cold, shivers, furrows and fear in the back without waiting
while we try to split the sleek future tense with trenchant
quotations. These are words swallowers of fire and life, one no
longer knows whether they're Latin, French, Italian, Sanskrit,
Mandarin, Andalusian, Arabic or English, whether they hide a number,
an animal or old anguishes eager to gush before our eyes like cloned
shadows filled with light and great myths.
