# Leslie Scalapino: Narrating



I just write, without advance plan as to a plot or form the writing
driven by a wind of my being in some urgency at the time. Each work
I've done has been written in that way. Each is different. The next
time I'll write dependent on what's occurring then. Here I'll say
something about Defoe (Sun & Moon, 1995) since of my prose it was the
hardest on me (in a state of extremity) and required the greatest
extension. 'Narrating' is for me:

Inextricably related not simply because events 'are related', but
because the relation intrinsically is oneself. The phenomenal world of
nature is inseparable from one's 'conception' (visual and tactile)
and also does not come from oneself. One is one's relation to the
rose disc-cloud on the desert as to social occurrence, such as
people's minute nuances or war:

"disc floating on the desert, with cattle that come to the edge of
the blue water and the white desert not coming from it.

One has to agree with them or is not there which in society can not
push out from themselves the red soft hanging disc. that is separate.

misery in having to be in agreement with them giving up being there
though one can't do that."

One can not be as social definition, yet that exists. That social
relation is inherent conflict as oneself in which one cannot exist or
be 'causes' the syntax to be a 'place'. Surfaces collapse on each
other, existing together as plates in paragraphs, clarity only
possible by inclusion of, or being, the conflict. Conflict is the
writing's shape configured and is attention in space.

Sleeping dreams are 'compared' to the literal "day"-as-surface as
if both day and dreams were surfaces as thin discs and placed
side-by-side the ego not in either of these but there also:

"One sees oneself as simply a shallow behavior that is thin. and so
one is free. And then turned inside so that one's dreams are sent
into one from the day, as they are it. So there is no REM. People rest
in the thin area. One laughs frisky. love in behavior is there, in
reverse. That is the street, the way it is seen."

Also fictional events and real events (the Gulf War) are placed
side-by-side regardless of their size:

"An object connotes by a prior connection or culture.

Where the object loses, or begins, its connotative existence is to be
just then non-connotative. (To see its edge...) would place the piece
at the point of dissolving. forming as an object and socially. which
is nothing. An object's form isn't anything as that. So it's the
point of the form and the conceptual meaning separating. (or rather,
being the same)...Trying to get to or to see where actions separate
from their social existence which is what they are that is their
connotative being, so seeing an action without that."

Action is seen 'without' itself in the sense that action (that which
is enacted, as physical movement) is 'other than' writing, the one
can not be the other they (both) are also phenomena as conflict, thin
discs that impinge on each other:

"Action collapses on itself and is compressed, in that it is
description of itself. It is thus in the present-time, still and calm.

It does not diverge from itself, supposedly. That's a conception
which people already know. Therefore speaking enables one to see the
diverging or separation that is this present. These actions occur as
if to make the pupil of an eye (some other's) dilate, and be held
open. The present takes place as 'some other.'

Life is dilated.

It does not diverge because description cannot be separate. as it is
of itself."

Defoe, the writer, created fictional characters who were supposedly
real giving documentary accounts. They were to be imagined as
entities, which had no reality. Paragraphs are plates of actions which
are not single and do not begin or end there in order for there to be
reflection (as the text) throughout everywhere that is not mirroring
of authority as authority is not (is not in) any single one of those
actions:

"To name it will be merely caught again in their authority as they
will recognize that as themselves and will be in their trap again.

If there is no area between his dreams and waking life, there is no
identifying with anyone.

Walk through stream of hot metal bumpers of cars that then move like
plates shifting. Mass of plates and she's veering in it. On tin tail
of motorbike of yellow teeth thrashing in neck. He's ahead then. On
it again thrashing neck. The bike skidding and swaying in narrow
channel amidst bumpers. It bucks forward. Neck bike veering and
bucking out on the vast tin sheet. the sunlight is reflecting off. He
wriggles free, lunging. The motorbike lunges forward. Crashes into
car's side in the mass. Slippery blood on his head neck slashing.
She's slashed hard slamming into car's side. Rider on foot then,
veering and is way ahead then out on stalled mass.

Seeing him out on the vast reflected expanse."

Prior sight we see things before they occur: whatever dream occurs,
that's waking life. Perception does occur in people (or 'in'
something happening) what is it?

"Perception occurs before the context it is not in a setting.

Without seeing it as it was going on while seeing it, really. The man
in being authority is the process of down fawning on the feet of the
other man while this is merely an image a negative that is imposed on
it. Like an angel.

Is it that seeing into the future as what's going to happen to people
it then just is that. It occurs. Isn't deflected. That isn't
continual change which is aware as we are in it.

We can see it in ourselves. that's why it's aware.

People see that later. Not when they're young. it's separate from
what's actually there which is to be seen directly. has to be.

There is no 'inner reality' to the destruction that this person is
creating for themselves from within, which is seen from the outside by
others.

So suffering is in oneself, and has no 'inner reality'."

The relation of creating a spatial shape as the writing to changing
what occurs (a friend dying from leukemia was having a bone marrow
transplant at the same time as the bombing of Iraq the illusion that
one could avert and change this reality while it's occurring in the
mind relation that's the writing yet the friend died and the bombing
destroyed) is an impossible terrain/conflict. The illusion itself took
one apart. It's an illusion that is bathos, like jump-starting a car.
There is nothing commensurate. Fictional jump-starts:

Real boys (and others) starving in the Sudanese desert. One is in or
has the dreams of one's fictional characters to make a particular
surface. "There is no resemblance between the boys and the boys in
the desert, that's forward in time supposedly. really, as it has
reality in itself and is separate from this. One non-reality against
others in oneself, it is seen between them. as oneself is simply that.

It isn't changed when it gets to this. Or by it later.

Dreams are excluded from this, which occur. That's convenient because
I can't remember them. dreamed one which met this red (actual) sunset
that just occurred.

This isn't it. Flattened to my inherent nature. I just woke up. The
man who was the driver deserted by the boys who don't resemble them
on the desert, has a dream:

Venus was hanging above the red smear, which I didn't see in it. The
neighbors with whom had formerly been at war for many years agreed to
smuggle oil to them.

It doesn't resemble them and can be reproduced and only seen in
reading as lovely isn't the market. Seen as lovely it therefore
isn't the market."

In writing: "The seeing is the event, rather than arising from its
occurrence." And: "People's experience lags behind the time
they're in." In other words, Defoe is trying to find the relation
between seeing (apprehension) and occurrence (events occur
'outside'). There is a relation one makes:

"Make writing that forms before motions.

As when I was in a rage, it formed first I'd forgotten it so the
anger occurred, I was in misery. Walking was at base and therefore
observation occurs.

Not observation occurring about it after.

Fictions are so simple that no observation occurs after.

So the fiction occurs first.

Defoe occurs first and so has no validity. It's not bathos and is
only distorted to be first or as being that.

So there's no Garden of Eden. There's not authority at all, that's
to be at base.

Walking occurs first and observation is not derived from it.

I want to still observation first. I started to walk one time with no
writhing and didn't remember beginning walking. I had nothing to
writhe about. There isn't a start of that, that's separated from
walking.

One can eliminate power in oneself by not eliciting placating. Memory
of what hasn't been seen before. So fiction (I mean all
conceptualizing) occurs where the real event isn't isn't seen, it's
eliminated, but is occurring or has. Openly doesn't resemble it.

There's present-time first. That's what fiction is, when it is
entirely stilled. It doesn't resemble the event."

Fictionalizing drives the mind-terrain into a state of separation.
There the dream abuts itself. A real event (such as here an anti-war
demonstration) also abuts itself only:

"The dream I had is closer to being because it abuts it then. before
it's occurred. This is in the present. The blossoms on the plum trees
opened. On some. Birds sit, and fly amongst branches of bare trees. It
has no reverse side, and is thin.

Birds skim low by me.

Wall of police swinging their clubs sweep forward. young punks with
tattoos emerge from the crowd, turning the cop car over and burning
it. They receive beatings.

...A memory as just a thin disc, as it is seen that way. There is no
event.

Warm, the birds stirring and flying. I had a memory of being on an
empty street in San Diego near-by the ocean; just that. that as a disc
because it became so stagnant it seemed it was going to collapse, and
be still. it flapped. my mind had become so tired its resistance was
going. The mind being weary as clarifying in itself.

... 'false joy' because they're lying to us. but inside it is not
their 'false joy.' It could be one's own, that is a thought. which
in itself is joy which bangs against it. The dark cattle stood earlier
with the disc of moon on the other side of them why they were dark;
when the sun was on the side (of them) on which they were dark.

That is in memory as the actual event.

The chest in one is struggling in constriction of joke. Trash. The air
cannot get into the rib cage. The thought of a bicyclist comes up
which is a memory and therefore separated from one, who is small. That
was him and so flattened shooting ahead. His back, that makes one
laugh constricted inside so that it's him.

So the flapping swans here so they're the same as the sky simply
flying is that (in time), before.

The entire day completely dilated is flapping in one's recesses so it
is behind in the back of one. Stagnant in that sense, as it's
flapping and then narrowing it in front though it's still the day.

It's the day in a sense, narrowed to a thin disc in front in which
the entire dilated day behind in the recesses of oneself bangs
shuttering on it. The day collapses in that sense when that's slowed
and interminable.

One rests.

One just sees from one's social group perspective say and then the
huge bright day is dilated flapping with that; so it's involuntarily
let go as it's large and while hitting the recesses in front of one
in the present, remains there shuttering."

Comic book style, the apprehension occurs via "the other" who has a
hole (or eye) in her side, everything seen alongside and flattened.
The visual slots or frames of the comic book (only conceptually
implied) can include all layers and perspectives at once, horizontal
and vertical. The Other is in love with James Dean who in death is
turned into a deer. She pursues the deer to rescue James Dean as the
black rain falls. She's traveling through refugees dying from blood
blisters on the roads. Her own blood blister is gently lanced by a
soldier who's driving the jeep.

The incommensurable relation between outside-action (in the world) and
interior-action mind phenomena is overtly the subject. The shape the
writing takes is related to use of fictional and
autobiographical/historical event (such as the bombing of Iraq) at the
time it's occurring. The time it's occurring the paragraph-plates
are real-time moment of exterior event brought into compressed
relation of interior occurrence/horizon together and always separated.
The intention is that fictional illusion be at the moment of real-time
to: implode it as real-time action.

These are illusions in the practical sense of being 'only' writing
(writing has no relation to present or historical reality it has no
reality, is it as well, being mind phenomena. So the 'ordinary'
small action is [to be] as much 'reality' as events that are
devastating). I am trying to divest hierarchy-of-actions.
'Hierarchy-of-actions' voids people's occurrences (that is,
individuals' actions are relegated to inconsequential or invisible).
Such hierarchy substitutes 'overview' of
'history'/interpretation/doctrine therefore to divest
'hierarchy-of-actions' is certainly a political act. (In
one's/reader's /viewer's conceptualization then [is the
intention]). What I'm referring to as 'divesting
hierarchy-of-actions' by definition has to be in oneself.

Making illusions and noticing them makes them so overt that they
'become' bathos. (I don't regard that as "alienation," however.)
Fundamentally anarchism (viewing that as being observation itself) is
necessitated. Besides **Defoe**, my other prose works (crossed with
being poetry) are: **The Return of Painting**, **The Pearl, and
Orion/A Trilogy** (reprinted by Talisman, 1997) and **The Front
Matter, Dead Souls** (Wesleyan, 1996). Also **Orchid Jetsam** (in
manuscript) and **R-hu** (forthcoming Atelos Press).
