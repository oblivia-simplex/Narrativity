| []{#text1}Excerpts from \"The Storyteller,\" by Walter Benjamin
| ^[i](#note1)^
|
| The art of storytelling is coming to an end. Less and less frequently
| do we encounter people with the ability to tell a tale properly. More
| and more often there is embarrassment all around when the wish to
| hear a story is expressed. It is as if something that seemed
| inalienable to us, the securest among our possessions, were taken
| from us: the ability to exchange experiences.
| 
| One reason for this phenomenon is obvious: experience has fallen in
| value\... \[The nature of every real story is that\] it contains,
| openly or covertly, something useful. The usefulness may, in one
| case, consist in a moral; in another, in some practical advice, in a
| third, in a proverb or maxim. In every case the storyteller is a man
| who has counsel for his readers. But if today \"having counsel\" is
| beginning to have an old-fashioned ring, this is because the
| communicability of experience is decreasing. In consequence we have
| no counsel either for ourselves or for others.
| 
| Every morning brings us the news of the globe, and yet we are poor in
| noteworthy stories. This is because no event any longer comes to us
| without already being shot through with explanation. In other words,
| by now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost
| everything benefits information. Actually, it is half the art of
| storytelling to keep a story from explanation as one reproduces it.
| 
| The value of information does not survive the moment in which it was
| new. It lives only at that moment; it has to surrender to it
| completely and explain itself to it without losing any time. A story
| is different. It does not expend itself. It preserves and
| concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing it even after a
| long time.
| 
| *Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.
| *
| Today people live in rooms that have never been touched by death, dry
| dwellers of eternity, and when their end approaches they are stowed
| away in sanatoria or hospitals by their heirs. It is, however,
| characteristic that not only a man\'s knowledge or wisdom, but above
| all his real life---and this is the stuff that stories are made
| of---first assumes transmissible form at the moment of his death.
| Just as a sequence of images is set in motion inside a man as his
| life comes to an end---unfolding the views of himself under which he
| has encountered himself without being aware of it---suddenly in his
| expressions and looks the unforgettable emerges and imparts to
| everything that concerned him that authority which even the poorest
| wretch in dying possesses for the living around him. This authority
| is at the very source of the story.
| 
| Death is the sanction of everything that the storyteller can tell. He
| has borrowed his authority from death.
| 
|
| \[\[I love this essay, although it doesn\'t address what seems to me
| to be a distortion in the general view of the narrative process:
| story**telling**. In addition to the story which is told, there is
| the story withheld. Attraction, narrative suspense, emanates from the
| latter. The story withheld has its own (buried) structure and
| tension. The reader marries the hidden story, not the visible one.
| That is why we continue to read a story that inspires dread. An
| attachment has been formed---surreptitiously. It operates like a
| craving, which is how I recognize Benjamin\'s reference to death. The
| craving for the unknown, as it is held by the act of storytelling,
| points to death (or its substitute, the body). (Roy)\]\]

| []{#text2}Excerpts from \"Fame,\" by Robert Gluck ^[ii](#note2)^
|
| There are contradictory reasons when I use \"real\" people in my
| work, and the contradictions comfort me. Any literary practice
| should, I think, derive from contradictory sources and motives\... I
| name names to evoke the already-known, to make writing co-extend with
| the world and history, and to examine the fiction of personality, as
| well as the fiction of the word\.... I propose self-community-story
| as a tonic for the loss of human scale; by naming
| self-community-story I participate in their disintegration, their
| progress from invisibility to something to be named and
| manipulated---to be reintegrated later in a new context, in a third
| term that history must provide.
|
| Prolonged scrutiny can become an expenditure of self, a potlatch of
| self. I\'ve come to experience the unreeling of interiority and
| sexual disclosure as such a loss, and also part of a historical
| trajectory. It\'s a writing activity that privileges the aggression
| of naming---an ongoing colonization of self into one\'s own language.
| Once something is named, you are in relation to it. Name the disease
| to cure it.
|
| We want to see a story as we see other representations: being hiding
| behind appearance---that is, hiding and revealing the body. But the
| use of real names \[in my work\] reorders connections and
| disjunctions. I do mean fragmentation. I don\'t want to make the
| predictable distinction between story and fragmented writing. Naming
| names creates an open form that co-extends with the world. In a
| postmodern switch, it applies the open form of modernism to content
| by putting quote marks around the entire story, turning the story
| into a fragment, an example of a story. The story floats---as gossip
| does---between the lives of the people who are its characters, and
| the lives of its readers (in that thorny field of reader/writer
| dynamics). The problem of figure and ground becomes a social one, and
| some of what is existential in the content is subtracted and
| reintegrated in the relation between reader and writer.
| 
| \... Using real names provides a relation between the writer and
| myself that carries some risk, like performance art. What I witness
| is always the same: any story hides and then reveals the body.
| 
|
| \[\[Two aspects of narrative writing have been subjected to
| devastating critiques: the linearity of narrative, and the
| credibility of the narrator. (The popularity of the memoir is in part
| due to the diminished credibility of anything other than an
| autobiographical voice.) The critical and political forces which
| produced these critiques have pushed experimental narrative writers
| to the boundary where form collapses into experience. The searching
| re-examination of narrative premises becomes part of the practice.

| []{#text3}Excerpts from \"Paragraphs Blowing On A Line,\" by Gail
| Scott [^iii^](#note3) [^1^](#note5)
|
| Entry 11:
| She sees the present as a great tear, a great rip in the surface of
| things: the gap of which is at first impossible for her to move
| across (*\...does not thinking seek forever to clamp a dressing over
| the gaping and violent wound of the impossibility of
| thought\...[]{#text6}*[^2^](#note6)*?*) It is awareness of this that
| makes linear narrative impossible. A virtually tragic awareness, for
| the writing \"I,\" which modernists began to \"deconstruct\" as they
| recognized that gap (accepted to give up power) has, in her case,
| been \"deconstructed\" a priori by social conditions. She is not only
| split between the self and the \"real\", but also within the
| self\...
| 
| So the question becomes how to write across the almost \...
| hysterical \... overdetermination of her gaps\...
| 
| Maybe my resistance to the narrative conventions of the novel have to
| do with what I think of as its Protestant qualities: its earnest
| representation of the \"real,\" its greed for action, its preference
| for the concrete over the philosophical.
| 
| A compromise might be possible: structuring the story by means of the
| fluctuations in her \... (dare I?) hysterical voice. The use of the
| voice invoking a poetic meaning in excess of the sentence\....
| 
| Blows: violent and unusual interruptions in her narrative
| texture-which texture the writing is hopefully starting to discover.
| More and more I intuit that it has to do with starting from a
| negative point: a crushed ego that doesn\'t see its boundaries.
|
| Entry 25
|
| During this whole process I have been caught between the need to
| accomplish this thing, which is both to posit some new kind of
| subject and to have the sense of being a subject myself; and yet to
| resist repeating, by creating a \"feminist narrative,\" what Barthes
| calls \... the staging of a new \"father,\" a new hierarchy of
| acceptable concepts. (*Every narrative (every unveiling of the truth)
| is a staging of the \... father.*) Maybe what my heroine discovers in
| trying to write her novel is only that the novel doesn\'t suit the
| (diffuse?) women\'s way of seeing things. Where there is closure
| (firm conclusions) in \"straight writing\" there are spaces,
| questions in hers. Even her anecdotes point to other possible
| representations, leave themselves open for reader intervention.
| 
| Still, given that my firm and conscious intention has been to counter
| (patriarchal) ideology in this process, the poststructuralist recipe
| for taking apart everything from the sentence to the author won\'t
| entirely do. Presumably I have to at least propose some other
| direction: language slips all around us. One\'s response to that is a
| question of the relationship between writing (what it comprises of
| consciousness) and body. Again to quote Barthes: *The text needs its
| shadow. This shadow is a* bit *of ideology, a* bit *of
| representation, a* bit *of subject: ghosts, pockets, traces,
| necessary clouds. Subversion must produce its own chiaroscuro.*
|
| \[\[It is generally true that reviews of experimental narrative do
| not have a critical vocabulary for what the writer is doing. The goal
| seems to be attaching a label to the content without \"giving it
| away\". Narrative practice, as a field of critical inquiry, is in a
| practically fetal state. Theory borrowed from poetics is not adequate
| for describing or investigating how narratives work, what is at stake
| in narrative, the social field narratives both operate within and set
| up. The interventions into the social field which experimental
| narratives perform are usually in practice imperceptible,
| indistinguishable from background noise, unless the critical piece is
| written by the writer herself. If narrative writers want the deepest
| issues in their work to be visible, they must supply the critical
| ideas that drive their practice. This journal will hopefully be a
| place that supports the development of that discussion. (Roy)\]\]

| []{#text4}Excerpts from \"Interview with Carla Harryman,\" by Chris
| Tysh [^iv^](#note4)
|
| Tysh: \"The I expands,\" you wrote in \"Realism.\" In this age of
| decentered subjectivities, how do you deploy the narrative machinery
| of the \"I\" and the various sensibilities it is associated with?
| Could you discuss the techniques with which you defamiliarize your
| use of the first-person pronoun and in general address the issue of
| the speaking subject in your prose. Who speaks?
|
| Harryman: My answer to this question is complex and leads to
| difficulties because I associate the I with power, control,
| destruction, gender, and whatever might transpire or exhibit itself
| between the poles of animation and passivity. Mine is an unwieldy set
| of interests, less easy to organize into the kinds of discussion that
| the problems of \"confession\" or \"authenticity\" lend themselves
| to; even so, as you will see, I am concerned with the relation of the
| \"self\" to the limits of knowledge.
|
| When I think about the I, what first comes to mind is omniscience in
| novels. (My understanding of literary device and the problem of
| authorship comes as much from reading novels as poetry. ) I will use
| Balzac as an example, because he has come up in my writing from time
| to time. Balzac wanted to account for all the history of France as it
| related to the ruptures of the bourgeois revolution. The expanding I
| here would be Balzac-as-author-of-France, i.e., Balzac as authorial
| agent/persona, rather than a deployment within the narrative text,
| which in Balzac is driven by third-person narration. I am interested
| in uncovering the hidden, expansive I. What happens when one
| concretizes it, making it evident in the writing, is carnivalesque.
| My writing parades various self-conscious positions in regard to
| constructs such as authorship, omniscience, and agency. It chooses to
| reflect upon the positions it takes and the relations it draws\...
|
| The deployment of the I through the autobiographical, the fictive,
| abstraction, argumentation is involved in the breaking up of unities.
| The I, as I think you are suggesting, does not expand but disperses.
| If the text is the social body, the I is mobile within it. If I is
| that which is not the body, it attempts to identify with the body\'s
| fleshiness. The I can be a code for seeking pleasure and examining
| freedom. Then it becomes troubled by its demands, for the relation of
| the self to the world is always troubling; it is never adequate and
| the I in its freedom is too willing to give up civility, a cherished
| element of comedy.
