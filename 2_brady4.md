| Once upon a time, there was a storyteller who introduced into a tale  |
| *one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, caught off      |
| guard, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the  |
| falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely   |
| incorporated and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude.* |
| Apostrophe runs away, as geological layers of forwarding addresses    |
| turn the multiply-enveloped scene of the narrative into a palimpsest, |
| with reference to which the only certainty is that someone will       |
| receive a paper cut rather than useful knowledge. However, in another |
| tense her face pressed out from behind the paper as from an interior, |
| all velvet-papered walls and lamplight, which the storyteller thought |
| to foreclose every time the story drew the curtain on a scene, the    |
| contour of nose and cheekbone solidifying for a second in the soft    |
| billows of that gauzy fabric which served only to insure that an      |
| audience\'s interest remained with what the tale hoped to leave       |
| behind, in its jerky gait stumbling from episode to episode.          |
|                                                                       |
| Again, though, I am lying, as she draws the curtain back and lets the |
| light fall upon you there, a bit below her in the street outside,     |
| where all presuppositions stand together in first and second persons, |
| and says, \"I am not a bad habit, not on the order of the forces      |
| \'driving the urge to differentiate, to identify one and then two,\'  |
| only for you to make the subsequent half-turn into saying that the    |
| latter follows the former, as misdirected speech follows curiosity    |
| about a lighted window in a cinderblock rental duplex on a dark night |
| with all the sodium vapor lamps shattered, duping an accomplice into  |
| accompanying you to that theatrical \"bad neighborhood\" in which the |
| passing audience method-acts its way into belief in the constitutive  |
| powers of its own direct address to the emptiness of its relation to  |
| the stage properties, when in fact I have been here, and have been    |
| telling the story of this circle of light, all along.\"               |
|                                                                       |
