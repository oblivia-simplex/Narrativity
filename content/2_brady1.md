# Taylor Brady: The Onset Exits and the Damage Done

 

 Once upon a time, you could say anything nice, but you didn't say 
 anything at all. Diacritical ultimatums interrupted dinner with 
 definitions withheld from view so as to grow huge and ravenous in the 
 dark. I am making this up, of course, as others made it up then, and 
 thus the accusation leveled by a doctor and anatomist of fact named 
 Duplex, had it been voiced at that time, would resonate still and 
 call me to account, but since after all I *am* the one who makes this 
 up, and since I did, and since what is done is done in that image, it 
 turned out that the good doctor had mortified his 
 voice[^2_brady1_brady_note1]1](brady_note1.html)^ as an act of contrition for 
 the grossness of a speech impediment as of that evening still 
 entirely prospective, and so no accusation was made, though a list of 
 sorts was made up. Have I proven my spontaneity to you, and do you 
 feel free of the memory of that night, reading over the 
 transcription? Have you swallowed your tongue, or mine, and can I 
 make it up to you?

| To rest in that is

| crust run faults, cracks 
| full of serious,

| The habit of that subject is the plan

| However all and each may speak of chance

| and only one. Two or more at most. Here 
| we have a logic of the subject very 
| frequently violated. Our one man 
| (or two or more) for the occasion, 
| Dr. Lyon Playfair, for example, 
| takes gravity to specify each toe 
| on which he stands alert, a point *en pointe.* 
  
| Hold that representation. Admit only 
| the material as in reasoning only 
| to the real, as it really is. And there it is, 
| belief in metaphysical fictions,

| fondness for a measured stroll. 
  
|         I study the varieties 
|         of humanity that move me 
|         and still retain the element. 
|         Even a least, peripheral 
|         sensation of pleasure, of 
|         pressure, tongue sliding over 
|         fissure, has its excitation 
|         and molecular gridlock. 
  
| The principle with which one sets 
| this weight upon a true continuous 
| plumb, a line of chalked descent, 
  
|     is named without appeal, 
|     trafficking in outlines 
|     on the bare, black asphalt, 
|     just inside the *simply there.*

Once upon a time, there was a storyteller who introduced into a tale
*one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, caught off
guard, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the
falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely
incorporated and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude.*
Apostrophe runs away, as geological layers of forwarding addresses
turn the multiply-enveloped scene of the narrative into a palimpsest,
with reference to which the only certainty is that someone will
receive a paper cut rather than useful knowledge. However, in another
tense her face pressed out from behind the paper as from an interior,
all velvet-papered walls and lamplight, which the storyteller thought
to foreclose every time the story drew the curtain on a scene, the
contour of nose and cheekbone solidifying for a second in the soft
billows of that gauzy fabric which served only to insure that an
audience's interest remained with what the tale hoped to leave
behind, in its jerky gait stumbling from episode to episode.

Again, though, I am lying, as she draws the curtain back and lets the
light fall upon you there, a bit below her in the street outside,
where all presuppositions stand together in first and second persons,
and says, "I am not a bad habit, not on the order of the forces
'driving the urge to differentiate, to identify one and then two,\'
only for you to make the subsequent half-turn into saying that the
latter follows the former, as misdirected speech follows curiosity
about a lighted window in a cinderblock rental duplex on a dark night
with all the sodium vapor lamps shattered, duping an accomplice into
accompanying you to that theatrical "bad neighborhood\" in which the
passing audience method-acts its way into belief in the constitutive
powers of its own direct address to the emptiness of its relation to
the stage properties, when in fact I have been here, and have been
telling the story of this circle of light, all along."

Once upon a time, there was a man named Birdy, older then than now,
whose job was to remind a text on memory of where it had been and why
it had missed itself there, as if he were a third-person argument
between a first and a second person who tried to keep appointments,
but whose lives, in the event, were compromised by one emergency
after another, so that one or the other always got stuck waiting,
picking up the check, taking the wrong bus home.

"Otherwise,\" he said, coming to his senses already in an anaphoric
mood on the curled linoleum floor, decorated in a grease-beclouded
floral pattern, of a dimly familiar kitchenette, talking to no one in
particular, or else an offstage presence stuck in an abandoned
episode, "you\'d simply live the singer-songwriter myth, and have
nothing to say for yourself but a lot of florid weeping and moaning.
I knocked a little hole in your wall because I care. Pornography
drives the photograph forward into full relation to its time, and
becomes a method to produce clear prospects on what was once obscure.
I continue to love your body, the taste of your tongue and sweaty
ass, only because I simply can't imagine you, and see not you, but a
broad expanse of sky, on the far side of every window into which I
peep."


---

Once upon a time there was a man named Birdy, somewhat younger than
he had been in an episode just a moment previous, who gave the lie to
epistemology and remembered the exact contour of every pain his body
had ever suffered through, beaten into shape, even, perhaps
especially, when his mind had been on something else. Sitting in the
dark and hearing, from a door or two down the block, soft blowing on
soprano sax, he experienced someone else's clarity out of phase.

*"I was afraid he was going to eat me,\"* a particularly
disingenuous character in the family drama was just then reciting, in
rehearsal with the cop with whom, arm in arm, he or she was coming up
the walkway of half-buried railroad ties that kept the path from
parking slab to painted steel front door relatively dry and passable
during the summer floods. Of course, since there was no air
conditioner, Birdy had propped the window open earlier in the evening
with a stack of crank pamphlet literature, and so heard every word,
but refused on principle to believe in the reality of any of what was
said under such circumstances, and was maintained in his condition of
exemplary, self-consuming skepticism. By the same token, though his
skull was perforated as proof of the most certain kind, he could not
grant the veracity of reports that told of a mutant, cannibal freak
lying just beneath the surface of the duplex and chewing on the
sleeper's head during the sticky night, but maintained that this Mr.
Article was, if anything, a fiction of grammar granted temporary
substance by the growing thickness of ideological descriptions of
landscape. Meanwhile the sax was licking lascivious promises into his
ear from distant, microscopic horizons, so that, when his one hand
found his other hand scrabbling around his lap in the dark, his first
impulse was to turn on the overhead bulb and find a window envelope,
write a check, and mail away his first adjusted payment.

Once upon a time, my little bird, you were saying. Then the           
therapeutic architecture, its medical practice sprayed thick over     
walls and fixtures alike in anticipation of each new tenant, opened   
wide in a tiny, repeated gasp of cancellation, swallowing your        
evidence in this incredulous and barely articulate displacement of    
pitch and timbre by pure, iterated rhythm, as if it were a quiet      
conflict approaching silence, becoming a branded product, and we      
promptly forgot it all, and had to wait to recall you as an           
after-effect of our own belated recognition of a housing crisis.      



[^2_brady1_brady_endnote]: 

*Dear Editor,*

*Once upon a time, you could drive through the city stoned and create
a makeshift eclogue out of that fuzz of vague participation, much as
earlier drivers had created their pastoral investments with property
in rolling parkland. In the windows which were not plywood painted to
resemble glass, but behind which were walls painted to resemble
all-encompassing skies, people would perform the parlor drama of
their social obligation to your passing. Going through someone's
trash, or the stack of papers on someone's desk, or the pages
inserted by a printer's error into someone\'s typescript, was a hot
and dirty intimacy. The substance of a whole affair might take root
in a similar sense of euphemism.*

*Ours,*

*The Editors*




[^2_brady1_brady_note1]: 
 Once upon a time a cloud of sobbing strings pretended to 
 protect the figure of a woman in what was either a song or a 
 landscape, hovering above her and around her like moonlight and 
 water, but only in the sense that moonlight serves as the medium for 
 speculation on nuclear fission ninety million miles away in the 
 opposite direction, and water acts as a lens, focusing what it covers 
 into a disclosure adding the picturesque to the particular. There had 
 been an episode of some kind, starvation had loomed, she had been 
 forced, not without some ironic pleasure, it's true, to eat the 
 still-squirming flesh of an Intellectual in Red Bermuda Shorts, among 
 other things. Some of these things were clear, while others remained 
 titular. Under the titles were texts, lyrics she was engaged to write 
 so that a man named Birdy, no longer young at all, but who saw 
 himself now as he had been ten or fifteen years ago, solitary and 
 intransigent and correct in a concrete box that housed a single room, 
 plus toilet and kitchenette, might within those texts produce 
 disengagements by which the letters would emerge as black designs 
 against white paper, and behind them, whether reading or hearing them 
 sung accompanied by guitar, the people of this landscape might then 
 intuit the presence of himself and his Apostrophe - for thus, 
 tropically, did he continue to think of her - she beautiful and he 
 evil, or vice versa, or all one way or the other, so long as there 
 was some sense of distribution implicit in their roles. He identified 
 the luxury sedan in the commercial whose jingle made him think of 
 her, and bought it with the last of his royalties from a previously 
 pilfered tune, and named it As Such, driving it around everywhere, 
 even on rainy indoor days, so that the city and indeed the nation 
 might fondle the exciting and aerodynamic contour of everything that 
 was surging within him precisely as it occurred. *And the pleasure of 
 being a lover, of living by love alone, was enhanced in his eyes, as 
 a dilettante of intangible sensations, by the price he was paying for 
 it*[^2_brady1_brady_endnote]. 

 Apostrophe, watching it all in slo-mo, said to the unidentified 
 others sitting next to her on the dilapidated couch in the 
 television's blue-tinged glare while the cheap VCR hummed softly, 
 "Here's the part where he begins to think he's outsmarting - who? 
 not me, even he must have given up anything but the broadest of 
 analogies in that direction - but someone, nonetheless, who turns her 
 head from side to side, allowing his right hand to drip something 
 oily and bitter into the balancing mechanisms of her inner ear, while 
 his left buys out her lease. *It becomes possible to cut off the 
 supply of light from a house.* Look out for the landlord who tells 
 you he sees through the vanity of possession, for he's about to 
 knock holes in your walls through which later to knock a hole or two 
 in you." 


[^2_brady1_brady_note2]:
Once upon a time, you were expected here, and when you didn't
show, a place was set for someone who looked more or less unlike you.
You are sure to congratulate yourself for having caught me in this
situation, making it up as I go along, but no matter, my aim's to
bend all light into reflection, and so I have pre-empted your
discovery of this point of fact. *In this strange phase of love the
personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that
the curiosity which you now feel stirring inside you with regard to
the smallest details of my daily life, is the same thirst for
knowledge with which I once studied history.* You have knocked a hole
in someone's wall and now there is nothing to do but look through,
even as you realize that here is not the character for whom you
looked, but perhaps a near relation, a time perhaps a bit early for
your arrival, in which a beakless old waterbird wanders in circles
over a threadbare carpet, casting terrifying shadows out onto the
sidewalk as its circuit passes and repasses the lamp to which one of
its webbed feet is tied by a length of packing twine that shortens
inexorably with each revolution. Perhaps it has been a long time
since you made any further holes, any perforations in the
thick-napped paper that covers the interior walls of such a scene,
simulating an all-encompassing sky which wraps itself around the
outside of a train of events you were only moments ago riding as a
casually interested commuter toward some other destination
entirely---a long time, then, since you were a child, shooting at
every hint of movement with a pellet gun by the shore of the
artificial lake behind your father's rental duplex, knocking holes
in beaks of birds to create the asymmetry out of which a story might
take flight, *but in this case the mind, merely by recalling the
pain, created it afresh,* lifting "that of which we cannot speak\"
into a chiaroscuro of yellow lamplight swirling down a drain into
darkness as warm showers fell upon you from the hidden nozzle of
theatrical night.

"Tell me everything you saw, and what you think it means,\"
stage-whispers Grace Kelly in the fascinated hush that cuts off the
supply of light, her absent presence in this vignette responding to
your recitation, which takes up each sentence in the discarded papers
blowing around against the all-encompassing sky and makes of it an
opening whose dimensions are given in the aperture of the vocative
"O.\" Framed thus in the round zoom lens of surveillance, do you now
see the dashing figure you cut from afar brought into the tightest
close-up, made ugly and atomic?
