# Nicole Markotic: Narrotics: New Narrative and the Prose Poem





**I am interested** in a dialogue about "new" narrative, which is
perhaps not so much *new*, as newly theorized. Many prose writers do
not consider themselves fiction writers, yet at the same time are not
really part of on-going poetics discussions which, for the most part,
do not focus on narrative. Although I also write prose fiction, I
consider my prose poetry and other alternative, interdisciplinary, and
innovative sentences to be a neoteric prose that both challenges and
expands language boundaries.

For me, the prose poem is a poetic strategy embedded within the
structure of narrative, and a feminist response to patriarchal
language and forms. By embracing both prose syntax and poetic
disruptions, the prose poem defies conventional linear grammar and
refuses to satisfy my desires for either poetry or story. My desire is
for so much more than causal, linear, rational and persuasive
normative sentences. In my novel and in my poetry, I try to live
between the promise of narrative and the fulfillment of the habit of
fiction.

By expropriating two distinct genres while presenting a form of
writing that is seen to consist of both, prose poetry presents itself
as hybrid writing; a hybrid that I explore as crossing between the
desire to exceed formal considerations, and the narrational insistence
surrounding such considerations. In my prose poems, I try to embrace
the problematic of poetry that "looks" like ordinary prose
narrative, yet invites disjunctive readings which may extend beyond
traditional poetic forms and conventional conceptions of narrative. My
pieces "fail" as poetry--yet continually celebrate the erotic
contradiction such failure narrates.

The prose poem, for me, offers itself as a "genre" that permits and
encourages me to move freely from sentence to line-break to full-stop
to repetition. Without entirely settling on its own definition, the
prose poem rattles my airtight nerves, upsets my crabapple go karts,
insistently and lasciviously rubs my discourse the wrong
way---inventing, always reinventing itself. Its very possibility
denies its own existence. For me, the prose poem remains liminal: not
merely transgressive, but indeterminite, caught in the phoenix act of
disappearing, reappearing as its own *possibility*.

My interest in this form begins at the level of the sentence. What
makes a sentence a line of poetry rather than an excerpt from an essay
or novel? The answer, for me, is the surrounding words and sentences,
the position of those words on the page, the complicated ache of the
forced return at the end of each "line." Ear and eye games, the
playing of interruption and proceed. Not stop-and-go, but
go-and-go-farther. As soon as I take a step towards the horizon, the
horizon reconfigures---itself and me.

What interests me about the sentence as poetic form is that poets who
are *least* interested in representational language are most often the
ones who turn to a grammatical structure which invests heavily in
sentential logic. The use and abuse of the sentence, then, seems to be
the focus of the poem. And because one sentence follows the
next--which offers a visual hypotasis but a semiotic parataxis---the
poem insists on a reading that is far more linear (for lack of a
better word), than is a line-break poem with disparate images stacked
one above the other. The one poetic device designated as prose or
*not* poetry, the sentence, becomes the choice unit of composition for
poets who intrigue me, shock me, paratactically get under my skin.

Within each sentential piece can emerge a plasticity resistant to
notions of purity in either prose *or* poetry. Gertrude Stein chose
the sentence as her basic unit of composition. Her sentences release
readers from the semantic baggage traditionally loaded into narrative
prose as they re-define, distort, conflate, skew, and otherwise render
the sentence pliable and visceral:

> A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle
> and nothing strange in a single hurt color and an
> arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and
> not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The
> difference is spreading. (**Tender Buttons** 9)

Such prose rumbles inside the belly of poetry, or perhaps poetry
shifts awkwardly within the abdomen of prose. Readers, seduced by
sentence structure, discover themselves trespassing an erotics of
prose, transgressing away from familiar and known fiction offerings.

Writers engaging in what Stephen Fredman calls "poets prose,"
struggle to create new ideas from *inside* the conventions that
constitute the either/or structure of the prose poem. This structure
is the chance for prose writers to both follow narrative and to
deviate away from story. For example, Robert Kroetsch, in his poem
"The Sad Phoenician," pursues an elusive and/but dialogue that
generates a bifurcated and pending narrative:

|  and        the Phoenicians gave us the whole works
|  but        what does that matter to a world that ignores
|               them, the Greeks got all the credit of
|               course, because they stole the alphabet
|  and        the girl from Swift Current, she more or less
|               took everything
|  but        the kitchen sink, claiming all my books, my
|               my records, my prints; she moved in with that
|               photographer from Saskatoon, the one who
|               takes those sterling pictures of the wind
|  and        I should sue
|  but        she follows large flocks of birds, I hear,
|               calling my name
|  and        pleading
|  but        why she developed a thing for adverbs, that's
|               too rich for my blood, I want to tell you
|  and

Readers wander through an and/but tug-of-war that is also a narrative
wandering, from the Phoenicians and Greeks to Saskatchewan, to the
very grammar of the telling. It is this *telling* that gets so many
new prose writers into trouble---isnt plot the very basis of novels?
How can one tell a story and avoid fiction? And why do we want to?

Feminist writers must resist and reinvent patriarchal language to make
it our own. We cross a border every time we pick up a pen or turn on
the computer or hum into a tape deck. The border is a visible line on
the page that the prose poem physically outlines. For many women, this
is not simply a gendered border, but one that has been criss-crossed
by social lines such as race or class. Harryette Mullen, in her prose
poetry book, **S*PeRM**K*T**, investigates the connective links
between the social and the linguistic:

| Eat junk, don't shoot. Fast food leaves hunger off the hook.
| Employees must wash
| hands. Bleach your needles, cook the works. Stick it to the frying
| pan, hyped again.
| Another teflon prez. Caught in the fire around midnight, quick and
| dirty biz. Smoked
| in the self-cleaning oven.

Mullen's disconnected sentences can be read to produce meanings that
address subjects ranging from drugs to poverty in contemporary USA.
But the structure of the "narrative" does not create fictional
characters and circumstances to battle these issues; rather, Mullen's
words entice at the same time as they startle reading practices. Word
association and colloquial speech patterns reinvent the chance to
re-enter the text from another crack. This text does not close the
book on the story, it continues to remind that reading is a
socially-coded act, and that a reader's subjectivity is constructed
through how she enters language.

Language enters me, and my sentences struggle against what I know to
be "just" a sentence. I hesitate in doorways and on fences, I plan
my route along edges and cracks in the sidewalk, I pencil in margins
made up of words only words, and then I cross over into blank space.
Not because it is "new" or "white" or "virginal" or any other
dominant appropriative term, but because the blank space is where the
prose poem offers a *visible* margin, a territory (known or not) that
hangs onto the edges of writing, clings to the edges of edges. I get
edgy when I try to read or write a prose poem, anxious, excitable,
downright perplexed. I hang about on the inside of this perplexing
form because it keeps me on my language toes: unsure and insecure,
tip-toeing across whatever lines a poem insists upon.

I "plot" at sentences and subterfuge, dream of a poetry that
withstands ragged-right fashions, yet continues to address narrative
within disjunctive non-lineated prose. I look to the prose poem as
mutation-- by definition unstable, punctuated by eternally reproducing
desires.

I want to carry words to where theyre already going, but not
necessarily to where I think they're carrying me. I strive to enact
an and/but *narrative erotic* that is neither fiction nor poetry, that
invites readers to see beyond seeing and write beyond reading. I veer
away from the end of that prose line, from the punct signifying the
closing ceremony, the final page next to the cover, the certain and
the certified. I question the metaphorical imperative that insists
toes are what we tip on, and grasp instead the reassurance of
instability, embrace the inability to embrace a stable subjectivity,
and echo cheerfully what Kathleen Fraser describes as "fragments of a
wholeness only guessed at" (**Each Next**). My prose poems
want/desire/lust after such guessing contortions.
