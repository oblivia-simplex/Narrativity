## Etymology's Nemesis

Soaring and diving with the aquarium sharks and casting another
shadow half imitation and half prebirth. Drinking of this aquarium
water tincture and thereby knowing something happened. Thus reaching
for the dictionary. Inadequacy's tablet, one nervous twitch before
story's wish to subtract by including too many particulars. Such
soft wax of impression. A highly sophisticated selection of pattern
for which, in the past, they had only the word "memory." In
Intelexa there is a saying, "Obfuscate so that the windshield's
film will clearly wash over you." This is not religious maxim but
the slay of time's desire to organize you into a bonsai beyond
recall.

 

 

 
## The Anchored Lost


Then she appeared---the woman of one hundred arms. First as still as
tree branches, then windmilling, but that is a word from the land
next door. Then the tale of the man who switched clothes with a
berber woman and went looking for the lost city in the sand. The
desire to paint without making a picture. This was the first story
for the first day and one was aware of that. "Sux - intravoxa,"
they muttered attempting to get on with things. But all that was
construed as thing had reverted to sky at the slightest glance,
embarrassed sky.

 

 

## In this place which Legend Posits

A silence fell upon the land. More quiet than a map. The sounds of
place having to do with the irreducibility and seamlessness of story.
Airlines want us to forget this. One body feeds sleep to the one next
to it. And the next imagines it as her own. For example.

 

 

 

 

## Paper Doll Day

| The egg from the other chapter has followed us here. "Revert" is
| the only word for it. A study of continuity necessary. Of meals eaten
| as opposed to meals made, read about, bought or imagined.
| Flowering thyme takes too long to say.
| Handprints on cars.
| Colander hours.
| Archaeology you can't touch.
| Ruffled hour, gravel hour
