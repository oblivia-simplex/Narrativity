**Once upon a time** is always here. Crisis, my origin: this fault.
Someone is called where I am compelled to explain. To make narrative
critically: this response to crisis. Otherwise it's narrative by
default simply because there is no other way actively to be here.

 

**From the Sanskrit root** *gna*, or know, our word narrative derives
bound to practice. In Latin, the root meaning appears to have doubled,
manifesting an otherwise latent critical difference. There is at once
*(g)narus*: knowing, expert, skillful; and *narro*: to relate or tell.
([^1_halpern_1]) A fault---mine, and ours---runs thru the space between. *Fault*:
deficiency, lack, scarcity; as well as slip, error, mistake. Also,
more critically: *fault* as dislocation or a break in continuity of
the strata or vein. *Here*, knowing is held in suspense and knowledge
is always potential. The process of telling/relating needn't connive
with already determined knowledge; narrative might, for example,
radically deviate, turning away from, or perverting, the very practice
of authorization, questioning rather than securing the position of the
one who tells. Here, between the overdetermined and the indeterminate,
*narrative determines*, that is, it constrains and enables, just as it
struggles and responds, testing the tension between knowing and
composing. *Here, we make our narratives ourselves, but, in the first
place, under very definite assumptions and conditions.* ([^1_halpern_2])




## I. Poetically


**At once wayless and wayward**, I positions a self *here* at the site
of narrative beginnings: place of mutability, place of many turns. The
crossroads of legend where every way is lost and every way is open.
Site of impossible possibility and paradox, where extremes coincide.
At once *here*: where aversion keeps one in place---*I: this paralyzed
fixture*---disinclined to turn another way; and *here*: away from
which every turn is perversion, an aberrant way away from the proper.
*Here* is forever shifting, the site of all potential, site of
suspense: where *aporia* (knowing no way, having no word, possessing
no resource) and *euporia* (knowing so many ways, having everything to
say, possessing it all in abundance) converge. Here is where I
intervenes in its own story, the permeable interface of averse
states---for example: impoverishment and abundance---as if with *two
faces averse, and conjoined*. In the space between states I spreads,
this narrative surface: at once this promise of disruption, this
promise of continuity.


**Crisis** is the point at which old orders no longer cohere and
*here* looms suddenly bereft of foundation. Here, for example, is
where Socrates steers his interlocutor: toward *aporia*-place of lost
ways. But what if this crisis could be experienced *euporically*, as a
moment of possibility precisely here where a way appears impossible.
Here occasions the paradoxical coincidence of antithetical terms. Not
the paralyzing absence of a way but the accessibility of always other
ways. Not naively, not as if everything and anything were possible,
but realistically, as if the site of narrative were the only place
where the impossible might open onto possibility.


*Here*: wayless, I is exposed; and *here*, wayward, I resists. It
seems so familiar: experiencing the simultaneity of political
possibility and impossibility. The fullness of the imagination
paradoxically constrained and enabled by a politically invested
environment which threatens to render that fullness innocuous if not
impotent. How to breathe this air that animates such cynicism, how to
live in this element that triumphantly promotes irony as the "task of
the day". Somewhere between the pessimistic and the utopian, where
these extremes coincide, where pessimism reveals its utopian bent:
here, one might ask how to think the moment when "nothing is
possible" becomes "only the impossible is possible". And here
another realism takes the world for its measure and referent: here,
where the limits of history, the bleak horizon that pens us in, meet
the pressures of the imagination.


**Discrete identities and sovereign subjects**---like the kings and
saints of history---are what they are by virtue of narrative strength.
But I am more interested in narrative frailty, narrative faults:
proxies and prostheses, artificial extensions, these interventions in
the world. Rather than narratives saturated with ends known in advance
of every beginning, I am interested in narratives that destabilize the
coherence of the I which, like a promissory note or stand-in for some
future fulfillment, suffers this contractual obligation to
self-identify over time. The self-same I, untroubled by difference,
might fill the space between disruption and continuity, but it cannot
fulfil it. The self-same I: at once the coherent *effect* of narrative
and the grammatical position to which one recursively returns to
ensure that coherence and whereby narrative possibility is filtered or
censored to preserve an ideal of intelligibility. Coherence, here, is
but the accomplishment of an optimal performance, a labored production
of social and linguistic grammars the faults of which are seamlessly
concealed *so as no appearance of any wound or hurt outwardly might be
at once perceived*. But there are other possible effects, other ways,
veering toward away or versing waywardly. What if, for example, we
were able to avow I's fictitiousness without and affirm our
necessary, if only provisional, belief in it. Here, rather than
persuading, narrative might perform its agnostic potential: the
promise of possible impossibilities that holds sway in the ambiguous
space between. This refusal of certainty, this averse turn away from
knowledge, this perverse turn toward knowing: this is not a
declaration of incoherence. Between impoverishment and abundance
(where impoverishment becomes itself a figure for abundance) the I
traverses narrative orders---disrupting and maintaining---while it is
simultaneously traversed by them.


**I goes between: a love story.** In Plato's *Symposium*, Diotima
locates Love in the space between ignorance and wisdom. Offspring of
Poros (way, resource, expedient) and Penia (wayless, poverty, lack.)
Love paradoxically embodies this antinomy and cannot give a reason for
itself. According to Diotima, Love judges *without being able to give
proper reasons*. "It is judging things correctly without being able
to give a reason," says Diotima, "surely, you see that this is not
the same as knowledge, for how can knowledge be devoid of reason?"
Jacques Lacan derives from this---in however faulty a way---one of his
characteristic figures for love: giving that which one does not have
to give. I am thinking of narrative like Love: wayless and wayward,
determined to do precisely what it cannot do. Its reasons are but
ruses. Between *aporia* and *euporia* Love is risked agnostically,
like a narrative that risks its own foundation. Sentenced and
committed, here, I goes between, exposed to every possibility of
rejection and loss, abjection and shame.


**Augustine and Stein:** Someone is called where I is compelled to
explain. "Well well is he. Explain my doubts, well well is he explain
my doubts.": this is how Gertrude Stein begins "Regularly Regularly
In Narrative" in **How to Write**. But the work narrative is called
upon to perform ("Explain my doubts") is alien to the work narrative
will ultimately do. Explain my doubts: at once the intended imperative
and the impossible end. My doubts will never be properly explained, my
uncertainty never properly reasoned away. Explanation fills the space
between ignorance and knowledge, but it cannot fulfil it. Recalling
another essay of Stein's, explanation is composition while
composition itself is figured as this "beginning again and again and
again explaining composition and time." And taking the perverse turn
toward the threshold of early modernity, there is Saint Augustine
determined to found the authority necessary to begin a book whose very
goal it is to authorize its subject. He, too, is concerned with
beginning, explanation and time about which he writes in the
**Confessions**: "If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it
to someone who asks me, I don't know." Between faith and doubt, past
and future, knowing and not-knowing, between 'he' (the partial
referent to which past experience is attached; it interferes with and
informs writing's present) and 'you' (a total referent---my
audience, my God, the other I love---to which "something more" that
escapes representation is attached and toward which narrative tends)
between all these faulty binarisms Augustine navigates a way to forge
an 'I': the vehicle and the effect of an other faith. Explain my
doubts: the self-imposed imperative to narrate, to compose a self. A
crisis in knowing runs thru composing just as narrative traces the
fault along which I becomes to articulate or align itself with the
world *in ways*. In the long afternoon shadows thrown by the likes of
Augustine and Stein, I am drawn to this, the faultiness of narrative,
its promise.


### To I this plot

>
>           --Saint Augustine



The problem of beginning, the order of calling and knowing, is a
perennial preoccupation of both narrative and history. In our
postmodern era in which history has illusorily evanesced, narrative
promises at once to rescue the I from an indifferent individualism and
to turn the present away from indifference. Augustine's double bind
is here: in order to gain knowledge and understanding, one must call
or praise; but without knowledge and understanding one cannot know who
or what it is one calls. Mistaken audience is tantamount to mistaken
identity. Who is listening. Who is out there. Here, along the fault
that runs between audience and identity, narrative and history
continue to produce each other. Here, an I is "emplotted." Here,
Augustine's address, his "how am I able to speak to you?." the
fragility of its beginning, awakens him to the danger of being
dispossessed of precisely that to which his I professes to cling:
communicative possibility. But who is the subject of that possibility
if the I who depends on past experience for recognition is displaced,
transfigured by the new experience of narrating a conversion: the
advent of an other I? I is this essay, this attempt, this fragment,
this experiment---like composition is explanation---this reach
transversing the pronominal distance between "Explain my doubts,
well, well is he explain my doubts" and "how am I to speak to you?."
In reaching out, I, discomfitted, doubles over the hinge of this plot
and risks a world. Between belief and doubt, this communication
without guarantees: the very condition of narrative possibility.

Bewildered by the question of containment, uncertain exactly which way
to turn, Augustine's move in relation to his audience is paradoxical.
Turning toward what "there is in me" he intimates, indeed creates,
the depth of a private self. Simultaneously he turns toward "heaven
and earth" revealing the self's dependence on exteriority. But is
there an essential difference between the two dimensions? Must one
*aversion*---one turn away---achieve priority over and above the
another turn? Or might a mutable perversion---a turning aside from
truth or right, a diversion to improper use, a recognition of
necessary distortion, error, fault---intervene thus making coextensive
interior and exterior? Privative and excessive, I becomes this
permeable surface, this interface of in and out: this narrative
tension between self and other. Paradoxically, for Augustine, only a
turn away from the destabilizing question of audience, in other words,
only silence or not-writing, can ensure his possession of a self
untroubled by spatial location; only a turn away from either way will
ensure comfort and allow him to remain confident in the knowledge of
such a self *without knowing it at all*. Self-knowledge as stasis
annuls self-knowing as narrative process. The very fact of
Augustine's writing is testament to his recognition that aversion can
offer no way; it cannot ensure a truthful I, only a proper self, that
is, a property which must risk itself in the act of narrating a story
of origins, a return to the fault. As soon as one begins to narrate
oneself, one is adrift, exposed to the hazard of contingency and
doubt, relatively unmoored but bound to the world nevertheless. In the
face of political danger, I mobilizes narratively: hazard becomes
promise as I perverts a way away from established norms. Looking back
I still obeys, only paradoxically. *Here* crisis troubles the ground
on which Augustine is authorized to speak as "himself." Every word of
address threatens to expose the subject to the vertigo that looms when
the secure ground of "self-knowledge" gives way to groundlessness.
And *here* it is precisely the move to explain my doubts, to provide
for them a foundation, that makes foundation impossible. Truthful I's
are improper selves, selves held in suspense, in potential and *in
situ* in the space between. In the **Confessions**, this abyss, as it
opens onto narrative possibility, becomes paradoxically the very
ground of love and faith.


### Intentional fallacies


> They who write narrative and history do not do what they say they
> will
> do when they start out to do what they are about to do.
> 
>             --Gertrude Stein
> 

> What the storyteller narrates must necessarily be hidden from the
> actor
> himself, at least as long as he is in the act or caught in its
> consequences, because to him the meaningfulness of his act is not in
> the
> story that follows.
>
>             --Hannah Arendt




Around every one of I's articulations, a story begins to congeal, a
plot thickens. Once upon a time, I stands in for this memory of the
present, a lapidary effect of all the stories I've ever told. Here is
where I unbecomes along this fault in the world, this cleavage or
interruption that opens onto narrative in the discomfiting space
between where I never fits. Here is where I encounters oblivion and
possibility simultaneously on the threshold of another sentence,
another scene, another world. "It was at the threshold of a world
such as this that I stood in peril as a boy" [Augustine]. But it is
not, as in Augustine, "my past foulness and carnal corruption of my
soul" that defines the narrative fault; rather the I itself---the
risk and the promise.


### "Something more"


> Do heaven and earth, then, contain the whole of you, since you fill
> them? Or, when once you have filled them, is some part of you left
> over because they are too small to hold you? If this is so, when you
> have filled heaven and earth, does that part of you which remains
> flow over into some other place?
>
>             --Augustine




*That part of you which remains* cannot be represented, cannot be
assimilated to any way. You---audience, condition and limit of my
self---an unrepresentable horizon coincidently inside and out of me.
"For without you, what am I to myself but the leader of my own
destruction?" [Augustine]. Or, as Sandra Bernhardt titles her film:
**Without You I'm Nothing**. Her self composed thru an appeal to the
other. Turning toward 'you.' toward the invitation to explain, I
becomes, thru narration, *in relation to*. Relation alone saves one
from destruction while paradoxically establishing the bond between
'you' and 'I' which erotically threatens I's preservation as a
discrete and coherent self. Narrative's prosthetic origin: this
other, who both is and is not I. *You may* be I's determining "last
instance"---an absolute referent modulated thru innumerable social
circumstances that determines 'I' in the final analysis. You, an
Archimedean point doubled and reflecting two horizons, in and out,
creating this field of apparent depth in the space between. You is
equidistant from and coincident with I's every utterance. In relation
to you, I's meanings are measured. Thus is I realistic without being
real. Risking nothing short of love, the voice aims at "a particular
absolute... it aims beyond particular objects to that 'something
more' that exceeds them." ([^1_halpern_3]) That part of you that always remains.


## II. Politically


**Narrative as counter-statement**. What is the difference between
being called to state (called to call a thing by its proper name) and
being called to *the* state (called to recognize one's place within
the established order of things)? I ask this with the belief that
narrative has everything to offer the effort that would resist these
imperatives, enabling responses to always other calls. Called to state
and called to *the* state: names, like bodies, are assimilated to
established narrative orders. But narrative needn't accede to the
status of statement, or doxa: rather, it is narrative as
counter-statement, as paradox, that enables one to refuse stately
calls.


**Edward II, a digression.** The story of the English king Edward the
Second. In the sixteenth century, Holinshed, the popular chronicler or
historical narrator to whom both Marlowe and Shakespeare turned for
material, tells us that King Edward "began to hold the nobles in no
regard, to set nothing by their instructions, and to take small heed
unto the good government of the commonwealth, so that within a while,
he gave himself to wantonness, passing time in voluptuous pleasure,
and riotess excess: and to help them forward that kind of life, the
foresaid Peers who (as it may be thought, he had sworne to make the
king *to forget himself, and the state to which he was called* [my
italics]) furnished the court with jesters, ruffians, flattering
parasites, musicians and other vile and naughtie ribalds, that the
king might spend both days and nights in jesting, playing, blanketing
and in such other filthy and dishonourable excercises." [Chronicles
of England, Scotland and Ireland, 1587]. "The foresaid Peers" is
none other than Gaveston, the king's minion to whom Christopher
Marlowe has the Edward of his drama implore, "Knowest thou not who I
am? Thy friend, thy self, another Gaveston." To forget oneself and to
forget the state to which one is called are virtually synonymous
offenses that render Edward a 'bad subject' rather than a good
sovereign. They are capital crimes serious enough to land Edward in
the tower, where he is sodomized to death with a red hot iron spit. As
Holinshed reports, the method was chosen "so as no appearance of any
wound or hurt outwardlie might be at once perceived." Death appears
woundlessly so that Edward can appear in state. Were this wound to
surface it would assume the figural status of a counter-statement.
Here, between life and death, continuity and discontinuity; here,
around this sign of struggle, a different narrative would take shape
paradoxically, this intervention in the orders of state. Thus would
the wound's articulation make it all "connectedly different."


## Narrative difference


> When you consider the very long history of how everyone ever acts or
> has
> felt, it is interesting that nothing inside them in all of them makes
> it
> connectedly different.
>
>             --Gertrude Stein, "Composition as Explanation"




From Augustine to Stein, narration has provided the way for
re-articulating the world in the space between, a space inassimilable
to already established orders, a space where discontinuity and
continuity together define a fault "outwardly." But what about
politics? What about poetry? And what about the division of
intellectual labor that traditionally separates the two? Marx's
**Eighteenth Brumaire** is often cited in this regard: "The social
revolution of the nineteenth century cannot draw its poetry from the
past, but only from the future." But what if the inquiry into the
relation between narrative and "social revolution" were to focus on
neither past nor future but rather on this space between? Right now, I
am reading Stein's **Narration** beside Louis Althusser's essay on
"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses". "The tenacious
obviousness of the point of view of production alone, or even that of
mere productive practice are so integrated into our everyday
'consciousness' that it is extremely hard, not to say almost
impossible, to raise oneself to the point of view of reproduction."
[Althusser]. In Stein's text, the question appears as follows:
"Can anyone separate themselves from the land so they can see it?"
And, as if in response to both questions, she writes "I am so certain
so more than certain that it ought to be done. I know so well all the
causes why it cannot be done and yet if it cannot be done cannot it be
done it would be so very much more interesting than anything if it
could be done even if it cannot be done." What is to be done is
precisely what cannot be done. Nevertheless, the imperative is
sustained: to recognize the unrecognizable, to do the undoable. Here,
the narrative imperative, like a Luddite wrench in the machinery of
state, would prevent the apparatus from reproducing itself. "To make
a thing a thing that they recognize while they are writing make it
something that had no existing before that writing gave it that
recognition, they tried to do this by changing something" [Stein].
This must be done. The point of view of reproduction is the point of
view of an antinomy defined by the apparent impossibility of doing
mutually exclusive things, like continuing and discontinuing,
localizing and sublimating. "Revolution" is a narrative not at all
unlike the narrative of conversion and it too is defined by paradox
according to which continuity with past experience must be maintained
in order to compose a discontinuous way *here*. Stein might be
discoursing on ideology and Althusser, at great pains to demonstrate
how Marx succeeded precisely "by changing something." might be
writing about narration. And while it is dangerous to reduce politics
to literary theory---and this is not at all my intent---it is critical
to ask whether any such success at making it "connectedly different"
is conceivable without narrative? To make it all otherwise: a
deceptively simple imperative. To find one's way
maplessly---aporically and euporically---along the fault. To essay the
unthinkable, to attempt to do it all by other means: that is to
practice narrative "as a socially symbolic act." Fredric Jameson
articulates this as a dialectical imperative: "To reckon one's own
position as an observer into the critical thinking in process...one
[then] no longer has to posit an end to history in order for
historical thought to take place." [**Marxism and Form**].


**Ideology *is* a narrative practice**. Narrative situates us
historically in the world. Once upon a time opens onto this critical
scene of telling and distributes an historical *here* equally thru the
space of narration. The scene is primal in the sense that it is
domestic; it frames a world within the world while promising a way to
encounter the frame. Narrative is also the vehicle of ideology: it
represents (in Althusser's formulation) one's imagined relations to
real conditions of existence; it is charged with the demands of
history, the production and reproduction of a world. And while
narrative can also intervene in the space between, narrators cannot
separate themselves from the land in order to see it. In other words,
there is no outside in relation to ideology, just as there is no
outside of narrative. To deny narrative, to resist its claim upon us,
is not so much resisting ideology as it is ideologically blind to the
fact that without narrative we are bereft of the means of
counter-strategy in the face of dominant and oppressive ideological
orders. This is telling, this is our common practice whereby the
limits and truths of the world are negotiated. In the making of
history, every composition is the site of as many decompositions.
Rather than the solution to crisis, narrative is the performance of it
(this fault to which I return and from which I emerge again and
again); not a repetition of prefigured limitation, but a
renegotiation, an approach, a reaching out that defines the world.
Here, 'I' appears as a provisional place-holder at the site where a
subject is called and assumed. The 'call' is a critical trope in
Althusser's theory of ideology where 'interpellation' is said to
hail the subject into social being. Accordingly, the ahistorical
individual is called to assume the historical position of a socially
intelligible 'I'. But I like also to think that, appearing as a
third term between the determined and the indeterminate, 'I' is
equally the effect of misrecognitions, incommensurable both with the
name by which it is called and the name I call myself. Mistaken
audience, mistaken identity. 'I' holds the promise of some
non-identical content: 'you' my audience and 'he' my self.
Narrative denaturalizes whatever 'I' and naturalizes only the need
to narrate. The space of narrative, then, is one of intervention,
conversion, transfiguration: where one renders oneself other than
oneself in a paradoxical quest for a more truthful 'I'. Selves are
called and recalled in turn. Augustine's ethic of conversion and
Edward II's ethic of friendship both articulate ways of potential
resistance to a prior call by way of a new response. Ethics are
ideological, but they allow one to narrate one's imagined relations
to real conditions differently, that is, to imagine it differently.

## Critical faith


> Only, how are they to call upon the lord until they have learned to
> believe in him?*
>
>             --Saint Augustine



But how do we come to believe in the I that is called? Stein writes of
"...names being not existing because anybody can know what any body
else is talking about without any name being mentioning, without any
belief in the any name being existing." Without risking belief,
communication lies in state. And belief, situated on the other side of
doubt and uncertainty, must be born in the space between, the space of
the call itself. This recalls Althusser recalling Pascal writing (more
or less) that one gets down on one's knees and belief follows. But
with a critical difference: belief needn't refer to the uncritical
reproduction of a dominant call and response; it might rather refer to
one *abandoning* oneself to a space between incommensurable calls.
Perhaps this would be the space of neither belief nor doubt but of a
more critical faith whose subject, whose 'I', is attentive to the
paradox: for what (or who) is the subject of *abandon* if one's self
is the object? While belief is necessarily ideological, ideology
isn't unequivocally "bad": in fact, it is necessary. Like
narrative, ideology enables. Here again, the crisis, the plot:
narrative's origin, this doubling along the fault which I essays.
Augustine abandons himself to narrative and in doing so the stakes of
communication are raised without offering the security of a
predictable outcome. If coherent selfhood is only an effect of
narration, and if narration is always a potentially destabilizing
force, then security is always already preempted when one risks a
beginning. This is both the promise of narrative and its betrayal. And
this is what makes Augustine's **Confessions** an exquisite act of
love, as political as it is poetic. "If poetry is the calling upon a
name until that name comes to be anything if one goes on calling on
that name more and more calling upon that name as poetry does then
poetry does make that calling upon a name a narrative it is a
narrative of calling upon that name." [Stein] The poetic tradition,
however, itself ideologically informed, has connived with the market
of names---authorizing it in ways---a devaluing trade in which names
are used and exchanged calculably as guaranteed referents, their
faults concealed. *So as no appearance of any wound or hurt might
outwardly be at once perceived.* Thus has the very need to call been
obviated and the space between, from which another way may be reached,
occluded. I believe, however, that in relation to crisis, it is the
response-ability of narrative to restore our awareness of the need,
and intensify our desire for another way.


And only by way of narrative might we unriddle "this knot of
imaginary servitude that love must always undo again." ([^1_halpern_4])
