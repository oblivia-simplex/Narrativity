A public thank you to Bob Gluck for his "Long Note" in
issue one and for his continuing to build arenas and
bounce remarks within them, against which I
can stop and pose and ponder in my rambling gestation of what.

And a poem:


### Concern

| little people-shaped creatures
| sit in the many many crevices
| of my tiery ballgown listening
| to everything that i say

| to be bodice specific:
| in my manifold cleavage,
| for i have twelve breasts,
| looping round, which makes
| it hard to deal with one's
| arms, they sit, hairless tiny
| monsters folded up like
| the thinker, one in each shallow

| to be specific as to length:
| near where my knees would
| be, if you could see them,
| there is a fragile ribbon
| arcing round, and still others
| hang there, like miniature,
| crucified men

| they jangle, jar
| quietly

Dear Laird:

Loved "The Avenue" and the way that it is laid out so interactively aids its metaphor, its narrative. Suits your work. I think it would be interesting for you to expand this, really think about ways to use the medium, work perhaps with some animated texts (if that sort of thing interests you at all) -- not that "dude, it's the future," but more like your work speaks about the fragility and transitory nature of reality and perception and I think so much of the experience of this medium mirrors that, is about that, so to have the experiential elements mirror your texts would be powerful, at least I think.

"Penelope work of forgetting?" I recently started reading a book called "The User Illusion" where it states that in computer informational theory it is hypothesized that the lion's share of informational capacity it having to rid the system of the old bad information before inputting the new information. Most of the "work" of thought is in the forgetting.

Also Bill Viola's piece at the Whitney where the oz-like loudspeaker fills the room with:

| the one who...
| the one who...
| the one who...
| the one who...

endlessly cycling ending each line of the mantra with
a different verb each time mirrored itself by a spinning
mirror - shifting light and perspective around the room of
stationary people observing this shifting point of view,
readers in some respect

"We live in an age of errata, of misinformation, of
disinformation, of hoax;"

Is this true or not true, seems to me the question. Working on
the internet, it seem like there is a pressure towards an
economy of increasing sincerity, frankness, as the customer
demands the facts delivered to him/her in personalized ways.
So the rhetoric is an experience framed with increasing
exactitude on what the customer not only says, but does, wants
in all the situations of his/her life. So it's almost as if
a current of information is existing beneath an old layer of
disinformation eroding it. Beneath the supposed clarity of
information are the hard facts of economic injustice,
technological imbalances, increasing willingness to look the
other way if it benefits the economy, co-opting the energy and
originality of the younger generation into the corporate
machine. But narrative is surely the guiding principle of the
dream of clarity that floats the information bubble, filled
with mysterious air. The metaphors of software are the
simplest or the most fundamental, "soft" + "ware" "micro"
+ "soft" poetry is programming fitted with a friendly masque
- the programmers, the passionate ones, have such
a romanticism about their code and the beauty of it, the way
it can be understood and built upon by future coders, that
makes one wonder if the efficacy of poetry to the classic age
where it was the primary communicator of civilization has now
shifted to the coder, who is fast becoming the primary
visionary and bearer of the fabric of civilization.

Dear Dan,



Where I work one of the things it is impossible to circumvent is this question of imbalance you bring up -- and while what makes .com headlines is the technology imbalance -- what we are still really talking about is reliable access to food, shelter and water, and some kind of immediate protection/relief from war, natural disaster and AIDS. I love the idea of a current of information running under/over/alongside the established trickster channels (cataracts a la aol/timewarner), and the narrative element of all these fresh tributaries, but fear that frankness will be a long, long while in reaching those perhaps most in need of it. For while the customer sounds his/her clarion call for straight talk out across a network that is growing denser much more quickly than it is growing wider, the big tv networks still run the stories that work for them and their advertisers, and in the meantime run viagra ads next to stories on the conditions in Andean salt mines.

Of course, to change tack, if we want to discuss stunted networks we can take up the topic of non-mainstream, challenging, slightly difficult to categorize, prose fiction -- I'd love to hear some thoughts on where the hell all the publishers have gone. It's a curious circumstance, and testament to a lot of hard work, that beautiful, beleaguered poetry seems to be thriving (with terrific outlets galore), while it is often an extraordinary battle to get a non-mainstream prose work into book form (e.g., and this is reaching back a little, David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress, which I mention in "The Avenue" and which is an extraordinary work, got 50 plus smacks in the face before being picked up by Dalkey -- to whose efforts we owe the availability of so many great works). There are paradigm breakers out there -- Ben Marcus is probably one, as is Pamela Lu and certainly W.G. Sebald -- but I suspect that a fair number of 'narrativity' minded prose fiction practicioners have run over and over again into any variety of walls. N.D. has trimmed way back and turned its prose eyes Europe-ward. Sun & Moon seems to be accesible only through their contest. Dalkey does mainly (or only) reprints these days. Coffee House does great things but can only extend so far. Likewise Burning Deck. Etc.

But, in the meantime (and I'm out of time), what I really wanted to say was thanks for 'taking on' what I wrote -- so often these things just 'vanish', much like Penelope's errant threads, and those emails I sometimes lose, into the mysterious air -- Laird

I wanted to add, as a postscript to my wacky change in direction (I'd been at work for about 11 hours), that Lydia Davis's work burns a pretty damn big beacon for me. An example of someone who has, for years, written extraordinary (no other word for it) prose that I look to over and over again. She has a fantastic 'little' piece in the latest issue of McSweeney's and a terrific series in the Fall 99 issue of Bomb.

So "narrativity!?!" : on the cusp of subjectivity and objectivity? But more than lip. Definitely animal. It can be but does it have to be kept on a "A chain of telling..."? (per Trevor Joyce)? As Laird Hunt whispered in the hyperwings "The work is in the reader and the reader is in the world." Protein.

Words enter my head sequentially and the sequence matters. But once they've all accumulated in my head, hey, it's all simultaneous. Like history. I guess that's what a clue is-- something that only makes sense in the context of the whole thing (whatever that is).

 Now that the story is dead, I mourn for it the way a killer mourns the man he's hit with his old car. There is a moment of glory when that man lifts his charred leg before passing, and I feel responsible, hence excited. As a child, I played with various types of knives and enjoyed the commercials of men sawing nails with strong knives. This then, like the car, is our tool. I am a hammerer and a Fascist. Yes, although I am not popular or even known, I feel strongly that although stories are dead, their shadows remain like some kind of fallout. Remember Dawn of the Dead? "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth." Although a bit understated, I feel this way about that man I hit with my car. He has a story. He was born Gyorgy, changed his name for unknow reasons, worked as a carpenter, had two retarded children. I killed him. But even though I tried, I didn't kill his story. As I live out my sentence, I must remember that.

Ann Bogle and Mark Wallace (NOTHING HAPPENED AND BESIDES I WASN'T THERE, TELLING IT SLANT)are planning to co-edit a volume of essays on innovative writing practice, called PROSETICS, to include essays about fiction and prose form. Our emphasis will be on practice rather than on theory, and with that in mind, we will also welcome writing about writing that does not fall under the rubric "essay." We will consider as-yet unpublished work as well as reprints. Send notes of interest to Ann Bogle at AMBogle@aol.com.

Ann Bogle's short stories have been published in THE QUARTERLY, FICTION INTERNATIONAL, GULF COAST, and WASHINGTON REVIEW ("My Crush on Daniel Ortega"). Her mixed-genre prose work has been anthologized in NEUROMANTIC FICTION, a Black Ice Anthology (excerpts, "This Was Called War At One Time"), 2001. Fourteen of her prose poems, XAM: Paragraph Series, will be issued by Xexoxial Endarchy fall 2001.

I find much of this writing on Narrative here interesting, but some of the ideations are becoming hackneyed at this point (for instance, Bellamy's opining on shock lit and pop assimilations). I have to agree with Bok's assessment of the ultimate literary worth (and taste) of many of the Oulip(i)an end-products...even though it feels like giddy fun when it's liberating us...to what end if the penchant is ultimately for received forms/taste or taming stochastic products into regulated modes of meaning-production? More of the "post-interesting," to quote a very well-spoken novelist? I also find the bitchiness of many of the writers tiring....so threatened by mainstream writers b/c of their "success" and audience appreciation....knocking the writers, knocking the audience(s)...the poor benighted audiences who so clearly WOULD want the much hipper hominy these writers are purveying....if ONLY they could be segregated into force-feeding pens in intellectual concentration camps for at least four or preferably eight years...preferably in california....and most tiring of all is the obsessive-compulsive allusions to "revolutions" (the ultimate tiresomeness of the avant-garde anywhere) these blindingly new embodiments of fiction will bring us...why don't they just admit they're after newer/rarer forms of textual pleasure...it's as simple as that, isn't it? ("pomo-lit is a badly aimed pomo-doro"--ghost of jack spicer on venice beach boardwalk, aug. 17, 2003) But maybe the books by some of these galling people--i HAVE enjoyed books by gluck, bellamy & killian among others here--are more interesting than their byzantine, cappuccino-scented theories...which are sometimes enlivening....if nothing else, these essays are rich in the anecdotal and the references to works worth seeking out...and some of these writers (thank bog) are painfully honest about how writing mystifies them...like renee gladman.....there one gets a sense of how the author stays interested...one more infinite game in life...if we only had the finite ones, suicide would undoubtedly be more common than it is among the "writing classes"...and i guess we all know their curse--regrettably "it ain't drink"--if we've read this issue...

I recently happenstanced upon Narrativity, and it seems an innovative, essential journal. As a poet, writer, and sometimes (when they'll have me) teacher of expository writing, I increasingly crave creative exchange & interchange of ideas.

I'd like to meet local writers who blur the borders between poetry and prose, and who challenge what seems an often stagnant notion of creative writing.

Editors:

Very interesting material here.

I am interested in the manner in which "desire" (as such) is textually mediated through narrative in a variety of forms. The convergence of "narrative" and "rhetoric" is also of interest--in terms of postmodernism, postcolonalism (re: Edward Said's, Culture and Imperialism) as well as in terms of cinema studies and, in a negative sense, the politics of exclusion.

Thank you for all of your hard work and for making this material available to interested readers.
