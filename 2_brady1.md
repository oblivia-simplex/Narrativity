| Once upon a time, you could say anything nice, but you didn\'t say    |
| anything at all. Diacritical ultimatums interrupted dinner with       |
| definitions withheld from view so as to grow huge and ravenous in the |
| dark. I am making this up, of course, as others made it up then, and  |
| thus the accusation leveled by a doctor and anatomist of fact named   |
| Duplex, had it been voiced at that time, would resonate still and     |
| call me to account, but since after all I *am* the one who makes this |
| up, and since I did, and since what is done is done in that image, it |
| turned out that the good doctor had mortified his                     |
| voice^[]{#text1}[1](brady_note1.html)^ as an act of contrition for    |
| the grossness of a speech impediment as of that evening still         |
| entirely prospective, and so no accusation was made, though a list of |
| sorts was made up. Have I proven my spontaneity to you, and do you    |
| feel free of the memory of that night, reading over the               |
| transcription? Have you swallowed your tongue, or mine, and can I     |
| make it up to you?                                                    |
