| The Elektra butterfly, an indicia, the small caps Helvetica bold      |
| font, the import Parlophones, their spare blank small writing. Those  |
| first few moments playing the English 12-inch singles, fresh from the |
| thick plastic seal, realizing the beginning is too slow, that you     |
| have to switch the RMP knob from 33 to 45. The silence between the    |
| songs, readjusting in my chair, preparing for the first listen.       |
| Rooting for them, noting who wrote which track, soaking up the        |
| essence of each of them while listening to their song. And the order, |
| the plot that album took, the lead-off rocker, the last song on side  |
| 2\'s power ballad. The internal band politics I imagined in the       |
| making of that order. The Greek lettering in a concentric dance on    |
| the cheapo compilations.                                              |
