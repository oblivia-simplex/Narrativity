-------------------------------------------------------------------

I\'m interested in the utilization of both poetic and narrative
tensions: the flagrant surfaces of lyric, the sweet dream of storied
events, the terror of ellipsis, the audacity of dislocation, the
irreversible solidity of the past tense, the incarnate lure of
pronouns, the refractability of pronouns, the simultaneity of times,
the weights and balances of sentences. I\'m interested in lyric\'s
authenticity of demonstration and narrative\'s drama of integration;
lyric, whose operation is display, and narrative, whose method is
seduction. I describe a set of binary terms across which I see
writing passing an exchange of values, and it becomes a multiple
texture/text---writing in just those created tensions between surface
vocalic tangibility and referential transparency; between theme and
emptiness, measure and interruption, the eternal present and past of
memory/future of dream; all present, all heightened, operational.
Such conflated writing would be worthy of Barthes\'s definition of
the text: \"not a coexistence of meanings but a passage, an
overcrossing; thus it answers not to an interpretation, even a
liberal one, but to an explosion, a dissemination.\" [^2_shurin_1]
One seeks to be out of order, to shiver out of
subjectivity, to shake off the mask of the material and to shimmy in
its arms, to finally retreat from logic and advance by radial
maneuvers, gathering meaning. \"To break the sentence,\" says Rachel
Blau DuPlessis---and here the sentence carries its overtone of
imprisonment without parole---

rejects not grammar especially, but rhythm, pace, flow, expression:
the structuring of the female voice by the male voice, female tone
and manner by male expectations, female writing by male emphasis,
female writing by existing conventions of gender---in short, any
way in which dominant structures shape muted ones. [^2_shurin_2]

One looks for alternate methods to proceed, to use and subvert the
codes at hand: stanza, line break, character, plot, point of view.

In \"The New Sentence,\" Ron Silliman suggests ways in which the
prose poem has used combined and measured sentences to interiorize
poetic structure, foregrounding language operations and surface
values in a writing mode---prose---whose usual form is the syllogism,
building structures of projection and depth. \"The torquing which is
normally triggered by linebreaks,\" he points out, \"the function of
which is to enhance ambiguity and polysemy, has now moved into the
grammar of the sentence.\" [^2_shurin_3] The paragraph as a
unit of quantity and the sentence as a unit of measure, altered
sentence structure, controlled and limited integration: these devices
begin to conflate the values of poetry with those of prose. Other
writers have pursued not just prose but narrative prose, and
foregrounded narrative codes to awaken a reader\'s attention to
process as well as result. In his novel, Jack the Modernist, Robert
GlÃ¼ck uses metaphorical and metonymic litanies side by side, showing
off the writing as writing as he demonstrates that the devices are
not mutually exclusive.

I grab his cock, unpromising, and he says in mock bewilderment,
\"What\'s that?\" As it hardens I answer for him, \"It\'s my
appendicitis, my inchworm, my slug, my yardstick, my viola da
gamba, my World Trade Center, my banana, my statutory rape, my late
string quartet, my garden god, my minaret, my magnum opus, my
datebook, my hornet, my Giacometti, my West Side Story, my lance,
my cannon, my nose-job, my hot dog, my little sparrow, my worm on
the sidewalk after a storm, my candle, my Bic, my unicorn, my
drawbridge, my white whale... [^2_shurin_4]

and on for another sixty substitutions, \"my cyclops ... my Venus of
Willendorf ... my Dark Tower.\" Four pages later the elaborative
metonymic process of prose takes over from the comparative
metaphorical process of poetry.

My troubles were too numerous to consider all at once, their sheer
quantity defeated me. My mom would say, \"Write a list, get a
handle on your problems, deprive them of their active ingredient,
time.\" So I found a clean page in my yellow legal tablet ...
Nuclear catastrophe, destitution, famine, additives, melanomas,
losing face, U.S. involvement in El Salvador and Nicaragua, Puerto
Rico, South Korea, Chile, Lebanon and Argentina, war in the Middle
East, genocide of Guatemalan Indians and extermination of the
native peoples of Brazil, Philippines, Australia, answering the
telephone ... toxic waste, snipers, wrinkles, cult murderers, my
car ... [^2_shurin_5]

Though these are both descriptive processes, they are not
transparent; the reader is aware of being in a list, enjoys the
ingenuity of elaboration and substitution, is held to the surface of
the writing at the same time she is integrating the lists into the
larger structures of the story. Speaking of description, Alexander
Gelley writes,

This kind of stillness in the narrative may be likened to islands
of repose for the reader, moments of collection. The hold that the
level of plot, speech, and action exercises on him is loosened. His
attention may wander, but it may also adjust to a changed mode of
apprehension. I am suggesting that the more circumstantial the
description and the more separate from the narrative in which it is
embedded, the greater will be the reader\'s part, and the more he
will be forced to assume a stance for which the narrative proper
offers little support.... When the familiar codes of narrative are
blocked or diverted, reading/writing becomes problematic, and the
subject of/in the narrative shifts from the characters or the
author to the reader.... [^2_shurin_6]

This problematization forces the reader to ask questions, to become
active in the role of reader, and GlÃ¼ck reinforces this tendency by
confronting the reader directly in his stories, \"You\'ll understand
my fear,\" he says, \"because television has trained us to understand
the fear of a running man;\" and, \"I can only give this story, which
is the same as sitting with my back to you;\" and, \"Tell me, given
the options, where would your anger have taken you---where has it
taken you?\" By confronting the reader, GlÃ¼ck not only breaks the
window of his narrative but creates and engages an audience, creates
a social registration for his writing by direct address, by luring
the \"real\" time of the reader into the \"dream\" time of his story.
The foregrounding of devices and codes does not neutralize them, they
are too full of historical determination, but it can ritualize them,
or expose their ritualization; reveal them not as necessities but
constructions---open to change.

Writing might use narrativity without succumbing to its hegemonic
orders of linear development, unity of time/tense---and apart from
the modernist reconstructing modes of memory and dream. A prose whose
paragraphic groupings themselves might be based on measure, whose
higher integrations might be thematic or associational rather than
developmental. \"How tenacious is our happiness!\" says Kevin Killian
in Shy. \"Unlike narrative, it invents and eludes itself from moment
to moment; it lacks conventions; its shape has no outline, its formal
properties those of the cloud---numinous, portentous, hungry....\"
[^2_shurin_7] And then goes on to produce a narrative with
properties of the cloud, numinous and hungry, where characters search
for themselves alongside the writer as a character himself, where
persons encounter each other but never stoop so low as to engage in a
plot.

The ceiling was gray and smooth as the beach that Gunther Fielder
lived by. Flat, and peaceful, the way that \"now\" is without a
past or future to rock it up any. He could focus on the gray and
try to hypnotize himself, closer towards death. \"Do it,\" he
demanded.

\"My name is Harry Van,\" he said. It sounded so false.
He said it over and over, didn\'t ring true somehow. Like somebody
else who you couldn\'t remember. Well try again, something new.

\"I\'m David Bowie,\" he said, experimenting. \"I have
come to earth a space invader, hot tramp, I love you so.\" Oh that
was so suffragette, trying to \"be\" a star.

He\'d start again. \"Hi, my name is Mark the dead boy,\"
he said with great difficulty.

Yes.

\"Are you Kevin Killian,\" he replied. \"Can I help
you?\" Just like the Hot Line!

These voices came out of his mouth from nowhere, between
heaven and earth, this conversation developing like a photograph
pulled from its tray full of crystal chemicals. Emergent.
[^2_shurin_8]

These voices attack the proposition that characters or author must be
unified presences, and suggest that self itself may not be locatable
along such a monochromatic line.

He is telling you now a story about narrativity, he is telling her
story. She finds the story as she looks at each other: so many faces.
She is crossing gender from the start, she wants you to know she is
Elizabeth Taylor---and has the Halloween photos to prove it. He is a
boy playing Puck in a high school production of A Midsummer Night\'s
Dream wearing ballet slippers forever. \"I have died and am in a
novel and was a lyric poet, certainly, who attracted crowds to
mountaintops.\" [^2_shurin_9] I come after Robert Duncan but
before Norma Cole. My name is
\"Broiling-Days-In-A-Little-Patch-Of-Shade.\" \"For better or
worse,\" says Flaubert,

> it is a delicious thing to write, to be no longer yourself but to
> move in an entire universe of your own creating. Today, for
> instance, as man and woman, both lover and mistress, I rode in a
> forest on an autumn afternoon under the yellow leaves, and I was
> also the horses, the leaves, the wind, the words my people uttered,
> even the red sun that made them almost close their love-drowned
> eyes. [^2_shurin_10]

\"Voice,\" \"Person,\" \"Point of View\"---always singular---propose
a unified filter through which events may be organized, and as
filters screen properties, screen out toxins and tannins and pieces
too big to fit neatly. But pluralities are possible. \"I see only
from one point of view,\" says Lacan, \"but in my existence I am
looked at from all sides.\" ^[11](#WC11)^ []{#text11}Pronouns are
known as shifters because they are by nature unstable linguistic
units, referring not to people but to moving circumstances of speech
and audition, visibility and perception. As such they are fictional
opportunities; unlike names they permit a character to be subject and
object, to ride the Wheel of Person, speak and be spoken of with
equal weight, inhabit simultaneity. Here is a poem from Alice
Notley\'s sequence, \"Congratulating Wedge\":

| No I wouldn\'t know why anyone would
| want to write like that. I should never
| have had to do it. We were used to this
| other thing we always know like when we\'re
| here. And you have this clear head and you\'re
| seeing things and there they are. You don\'t
| notice they\'re spelled. That\'s how you
| know you\'re alive. I never saw you
| looking like a dictionary definition and if I
| did I wouldn\'t tell nobody. People
| aren\'t like that. They say, Hey
| asshole motherfucker turn that radio
| off! But the sun\'s playing on it! But
| it ain\'t real, you dumb package!
| I recognize every package the way it
| comes. Now I\'m mixed up. But I
| always wanted to be a package, person
| thinks. Do they? Or, I gotta de-
| fine this package, me. Or, God if only
| I was a package but I\'m not.
[^2_shurin_12]

What are people like and what method correctly presents/represents
them; from what angles are they constructed and who construes the
angles into voice? In her mind as \"I,\" out of her mind as \"she,\"
confronting or confronted by \"you\"; conspiratorially social and
partial as \"we\"; part of one another, occasionally indistinct,
certainly indiscreet, we are and we are not separate people. \"My
premise, in general and in writing,\" says Leslie Scalapino, \"is
that I do not think there is a man, or woman, or society, social
construction; though it is there. It is not there.\" [^2_shurin_13]
I have been marginalized as a poet, homosexual,
counterculture protester, drug taker, transvestite and Jew; I am as
interested in boundaries for what lies outside them as in. I would
like to drop my \"characters\" onto the sharpened point of a
gemstone, so that the radial fractures would illuminate a
comprehensive pluralistic image.

Syntax is the plot of the sentence, a systematic ordering of person
and event, of who does what to whom and when and to what end. Encoded
in its structure are a variety of fixed agreements that always end in
a point (.) Who will speak for beside-the-point? Nouns and verbs must
have parallel numbers, pronouns and verbs parallel persons; tenses
must agree to produce time that resembles progression. Business
conveniences that make of stories little prisons of discrete power
relations with seemingly invisible walls. I am not talking about
referentiality vs. non-referentiality; I\'m talking about how
narrative referentiality might be better served. Gender is
foregrounded and elementalized, digressions are trivialized, passive
constructions frowned upon. As Sara Schulman points out, try to tell
a lesbian story without names: she came into a room, she looked at
her, she looked at her, she said---and aside from homophobia, what
terrors would such unlocations unleash? Normative pronoun usage
subjects self and other to power/dominance models of unity and
authority, of he over she and it beneath them. For pure syntax there
is Charley Shively\'s reduction of the phallocentric rule: \"the
subject fucks the object.\"[^2_shurin_14]

Here is Leslie Scalapino writing:

> The young person living there, having an intense tortured as if
> tearing in half pain in the middle, waking lying asleep, though
> this had only occurred this one time. The day and night being free
> of the one person, who hadn\'t had this tortured sharp pain as if
> to tear her in half except this one time, the man lying waking
> staying gently with her during it through the soft darkness and
> then ending in the warm balmy day with the people around who go
> down the street.[^2_shurin_15]

Passive participial constructions which don\'t inhabit time,
genderless and then confusing gender assignations, unlocated relative
pronouns, erratic time shifts without one simple present tense: an
amalgam of person and event that keeps elements suspended and active,
\"an explosion, a dissemination\" of meaning. \"His mouth are
everywhere,\" I wrote erotically in \"Honor Roll,\" insisting that
the plural verb was truer to the polyvalence of desire.

And I have neither a coherent story to tell nor can I cop a coherent
attitude to give my voice a characteristic singularity. I was born in
sleep and raised in sleep and wake up to find myself sleepwalking.
The figures I know all have shadows; some figures are smaller than
their shadows. In the first photo I am a soft blasted thing, mouth
open tongue hanging, blotto. Six weeks premature, I was still \"in
here\" out there. The world was unformed, coalescent. His story is
the story of an intuited world, a story where digressions may be the
point, where ellipsis is an accurate representation of what there is.

This world in its order decomposes into air, simultaneously present
and absent. A writing, then, of enmeshed simultaneities, which gives
sufficient weight to its constituent presences so that they verge
upon each other. The material relations of the Unknown. \"The stuff
of the psyche,\" says Herakleitos, \"is a smoke-like substance of
finest particles, that give rise to all other things.... it is
constantly in motion: only movement can know movement.\"
[^2_shurin_16] His story pulls the reader down from the
surface of language not to rest but to ride back and forth between
the manifest and imaginary worlds, among selves. \"I wanted to write
a story,\" he begins, \"to talk about the outside world and escape my
projections, but the outside world could not escape from my
projections. I wanted to write not \'my\' story but \'theirs\'; I
wanted to write about evil.\" He looks at his fingers to escape your
accusations; a sunbeam deconstructs him into motes. He is happy
dissolved there, and wants to write from such dissolutions, melting
into the grain of his lover\'s nipples. He has no lover; he has
entered an argument about narrative and political ruination. \"Tell
me your story,\" he asks, and you do.

Here in this dialogue writing relies less on information, as Walter
Benjamin shows, than on the moral power of interpretation, \"to keep
a story free from explanation.\" It is left up to the reader to
\"interpret things the way he understands them, and thus narrative
achieves an amplitude that information lacks.\"[^2_shurin_17]
Here a fabricated house open to the wind is both a shelter
and a sharpener of the wind\'s bite, a house of shadows and a moving
shadow that resembles a house. Narrativity, the action not the thing,
a happening semblance that is and is not a story, a gift given and
taken away so that one must finally stand fulfilled by transgression.
Narrativity, a process of integration not linear but aggregate,
circular, partial---and so, complete.
