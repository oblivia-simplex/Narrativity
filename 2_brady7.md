| Once upon a time, my little bird, you were saying. Then the           |
| therapeutic architecture, its medical practice sprayed thick over     |
| walls and fixtures alike in anticipation of each new tenant, opened   |
| wide in a tiny, repeated gasp of cancellation, swallowing your        |
| evidence in this incredulous and barely articulate displacement of    |
| pitch and timbre by pure, iterated rhythm, as if it were a quiet      |
| conflict approaching silence, becoming a branded product, and we      |
| promptly forgot it all, and had to wait to recall you as an           |
| after-effect of our own belated recognition of a housing crisis.      |
