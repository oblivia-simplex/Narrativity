| *from* **Tristram Shandy**
| Laurence Sterne
| First published 1760
|
| Chapter V
|
| On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the era fixed on was as
| near nine calendar months as any husband could in reason have
| expected, --- was I, Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought forth into
| this scurvy and disastrous world of ours. --- I wish I had been born
| on the Moon, or in any of the planets (except Jupiter or Saturn,
| because I never could bear cold weather), for it could not well have
| fared worse with me in any of them (though I will not answer for
| Venus) than it has in this vile, dirty planet of ours, --- which o\'
| my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to be made up of
| the shreds and clippings of the rest; --- not but the planet is well
| enough, provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a
| great estate; or could anyhow contrive to be called up to public
| charges, and employments of dignity or power; --- but that is not my
| case; --- and therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own
| market has gone in it; --- for which cause I affirm it over again to
| be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made; --- for I can truly
| say that from the first hour I drew my breath in it, to this, that I
| can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got in skating against
| the wind in Flanders, --- I have been the continual sport of what the
| world calls fortune; and though I will not wrong her by saying, She
| has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil; --- yet
| with all the good temper in the world, I affirm it of her that in
| every stage of my life, and at every turn and corner where she could
| get fairly at me, the ungracious Duchess has pelted me with a set of
| as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero
| sustained.

|
| Chapter VI
|
| In the beginning of the last chapter, I informed you exactly *when* I
| was born; --- but I did not inform you *how*. *No*; that particular
| was reserved entirely for a chapter by itself; --- besides, Sir, as
| you and I are in a manner perfect strangers to each other, it would
| not have been proper to have let you into to many circumstances
| relating to myself all at once. --- You must have a little patience.
| I have undertaken, you see, to write not only my life, but my
| opinions also; hoping and expecting that your knowledge of my
| character, and of what kind of a mortal I am, by the one, would give
| you a better relish for the other: As you proceed further with me,
| the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt us will grow
| into familiarity; and that, unless one of us is in fault, will
| terminate in friendship. --- *O diem praeclarum!* --- then nothing
| which has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature, or
| tedious in its telling. Therefore, my dear friend and companion, if
| you should think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first
| setting out, --- bear with me, --- and let me go on, and tell my
| story my own way: --- or if I should seem now and then to trifle upon
| the road, --- or should sometimes put on a fool\'s cap with a bell to
| it, for a moment or two as we pass along, --- don\'t fly off, --- but
| rather courteously give me credit for a little more wisdom than
| appears upon my outside; --- and as we jog on, either laugh with me,
| or at me, or in short, do anything, --- only keep your temper.

| *from* **The Confessions of Saint Augustine**
| Translated by Edward B. Pusey, D.D.
| First published c. 400 A.D.
|
| Afterwards I began to smile; first in sleep, then waking: for so it
| was told me of myself, and I believed it; for we see the like in
| other infants, though of myself I remember it not. Thus, little by
| little, I became conscious where I was; and to have a wish to express
| my wishes to those who could content them, and I could not; for the
| wishes were within me, and they without; nor could they be any sense
| of theirs enter within my spirit. So I flung about at random limbs
| and voice, making the few signs I could, and such as I could, like,
| though in truth very little like, what I wished. And when I was not
| presently obeyed (my wishes being hurtful or unintelligible), then I
| was indignant with my elders for not submitting to me, with those
| owing me no service, for not serving me; and avenged myself on them
| by tears. Such have I learnt infants to be from observing them; and
| that I was myself such, they, all unconscious, have shown me better
| than my nurses who knew it.
| 
| Passing hence from infancy, I came to boyhood, or rather it came to
| me, displacing infancy. Now did that depart, --- (for wither went
| it?) --- and yet it was no more. For I was no longer a speechless
| infant, but a speaking boy. This I remember; and have since observed
| how I learned to speak. It was not that my elders taught me words
| (as, soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by
| cries and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express
| my thoughts, that so I might have my will, and yet unable to express
| all I willed, or to whom I willed, did myself, by the understanding
| which Thou, my God, gavest me, practice the sounds in my memory. When
| they named any thing, and as they spoke turned towards it, I saw and
| remembered that they called what they would point out by the name
| they uttered. And that they meant this thing and no other was plain
| from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were, of
| all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye,
| gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice, indicating the
| affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or shuns.
| And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various
| sentences, I collected gradually for what they stood; and having
| broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave utterance to my
| will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs of our
| wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human
| life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders.

| *from* **Our Lady of the Flowers**
| Jean Genet
| Translated by Bernard Frechtman
| First published 1943
|
| Our Lady of the Flowers, still and already wearing the light, baggy,
| youthful, preposterously tin and, in a word, ghostlike gray-flannel
| suit that he was wearing the day of the crime and that he will be
| wearing the day of his death, came there to buy a ticket for Le
| Havre. Just as he got to the platform, he dropped his wallet which
| was stiff with the twenty thousand franc notes. He felt it slip from
| his pocket and turned around just in time to see it being picked up
| by Darling. Calmly and fatally, Darling examined it, for though he
| was a genuine crook, nevertheless he did not know how to be at ease
| in original postures and imitated the gangsters of Chicago and
| Marseilles. This simple observation also enables us to indicate the
| importance of dreaming in the life of the hoodlum, but what I want
| particularly to show you by means of it is that I shall surround
| myself only with roughnecks of undistinguished personality, with none
| of the nobility that comes from heroism. My loved ones will be those
| whom you would call \"hoodlums of the worst sort.\"
|
| Darling counted the bills. He took ten for himself, put them into his
| pocket and handed the rest to Our Lady, who stood there dumbfounded.
| They became friends.
|
| I leave you free to imagine any dialogue you please. Choose whatever
| may charm you. Have it, if you like, that they hear the voice of the
| blood, or that they fall in love at first sight, or that Darling, by
| indisputable signs invisible to the vulgar eye, betrays the fact that
| he is a thief\...Conceive the wildest improbabilities. Have it that
| the depths of their being are thrilled at accosting each other in
| slang. Tangle them suddenly in a swift embrace or a brotherly kiss.
| Do whatever you like.

| *from* **Spacetime, Geometry, Cosmology**
| William L. Burke
| University Science Books, Mill Valley, 1980.
|
| 
| What does it mean to make a model of the universe? We must ask such
| questions, even though they seem to belong in the realm of
| philosophy, because of the fundamental nature of the subject itself.
| A good analogy for this model making is the construction of a map of
| a city. The city and the map of the city are two distinct things that
| no one would confuse. This confusion is harder to avoid in cosmology.
| To be useful, the map must be faithful to some of the city\'s
| interesting properties. Furthermore, the map is constructed according
| to some specific conventions: major roads are in red; north is at the
| top; and so on. Also, a map does not try to define what a road is.
| That you learn by demonstration. People point out roads and non-roads
| to you, and you acquire the idea of a road by induction. Such basic
| ideas, which are not defined but are learned by demonstration, are
| called *primitive notions*.
|
| The same things will be true of the models of physical reality that
| we make. We will construct a map of the world according to some
| specific but arbitrary conventions. The image is constructed not on
| paper, but in terms of some mathematical structure, such as a linear
| vector space. Because we can talk about physical reality only in
| terms of some model, it is easy for us to forget the distinction
| between the object itself and our model of the object. As in our map
| of the city, there are some undefined elements in our model. For
| spacetime, these primitive notions are *event, free particle, clock,*
| and *light signal.* We will describe in words what these correspond
| to, much as a roadmap might discuss what it does in fact consider to
| be an acceptable road.
|
| An important feature of any model is *coarse-graining.* The model
| ignores a lot of things. The exact width, surface, and color of a
| road cannot be deduced from the ordinary roadmap. In fact, the
| roadmap is more useful than a photograph precisely because it omits
| such irrelevant detail. Similarly, there is a coarse-graining in our
| primitive notions for spacetime. For example, we will not describe a
| clock by making a detailed model of its internal construction. Such
| details will not be mentioned. The model presumes that they are
| irrelevant, and it is the task of experiment to verify this.

| *from* **The Passion**
| Jeanette Winterson
| Vintage Books, 1989
|
| Lovers are not at their best when it matters. Mouths dry up, palms
| sweat, conversation flags and all the time the heart is threatening
| to fly from the body once and for all. Lovers have been known to have
| heart attacks. Lovers drink too much from nervousness and cannot
| perform. They eat too little and faint during their fervently wished
| consummation. They do not stroke the favoured cat and their
| face-paint comes loose. This is not all. Whatever you have set store
| by, your dress, your dinner, your poetry, will go wrong.
| 
| How is it that one day life is orderly and you are content, a little
| cynical perhaps but on the whole just so, and then without warning
| you find the solid floor is a trapdoor and you are now in another
| place whose geography is uncertain and whose customs are strange.
|
| Travellers at least have a choice. Those who set sail know that
| things will not be the same as at home. Explorers are prepared. But
| for us, who travel along the blood vessels, who come to the cities of
| the interior by chance, there is no preparation. We who were fluent
| find life is a foreign language. Somewhere between the swamp and the
| mountains. Somewhere between fear and sex. Somewhere between God and
| the Devil passion is and the way there is sudden and the way back is
| worse.
|
| I\'m surprised at myself for talking in this way. I\'m young, the
| world is before me, there will be others. I feel my first streak of
| defiance since I met her. My first upsurge of self. I won\'t see her
| again. I can go home, throw aside these clothes and move on. I can
| move out if I like. I\'m sure the meat man can be persuaded to take
| me to Paris for a favour or two.
|
Passion, I spit on it.

I spat into the canal.
