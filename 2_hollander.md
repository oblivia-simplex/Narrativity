| **Working Notes:**
|
| *Serialscribbler (as the title suggests) is an ongoing work, so far
| only in prose, though there\'s no rule about that. It started a
| couple of years ago, when I sent out a piece of scribble on a
| postcard every day to someone I knew around the world. The texts were
| continuous (a lot of drivel thrown in) but each recipient only
| received a fragment. The idea was to re-integrate other people\'s
| (not necessarily writers or artists of any description) responses in
| my own writing. So far, that hasn\'t happened, and after some 120
| postcards I stopped sending them out, especially as the internet
| seems to throw a slightly anachronistic twist on the project. For the
| time being, then, it\'s still an open-ended project and anything
| might happen with it.*
|
| *From some working notes on Serialscribbler found in my notebooks
| from the last few years:*
|
| *The language eludes me just as I step into it. I do not have the
| power to seize it, let alone transform it.*
|
| *Serialscribbler---what is more than language in it---
| now sit in Waterloo station
| now hear & be tempted to bark
| but not bark, quarantine---look up \"bark\"---
| then & now reconciled (thru fog)---may as well not pay & suffer the
| consequences---what if someone gets up & leaves in the middle of a
| word---how do we find the middle of a word---if poetry is an
| approximation, the world is a wild guess---guests come & go, trains
| depart & arrive, film rolls.*
|
| *Snatch scribbler---between picking up dog shit & chasing after the
| puppy, the memorable phrase or fragment might fall into place. More
| likely it will not. Take in the decent weather while it lasts---a day
| or two---then brace yourself for the onslaught of dark winter days.*
|
| *Write without closure, as if each block of text were a prelude to
| the soundwork or video. Take it one sense at a time and then
| return--- not quite, but in a spiralling form rather than a circle---
| serialscribbler.*
|
| *\"the natural suspicion of words\"*
|
| *Sometimes it happens that even Serialscribbler, who by definition is
| busy at all times if not totally self-absorbed to the point of
| oblivion, sometimes (I say) it happens that Serialscribbler will
| devote some attention to another experience, eg, reading a
| stranger\'s book or looking at a sculpture, even feeling it to gain
| some tactile experience of it.*
|
| *I write in prose by default . I don\'t know where to break the line
| in free verse and I don\'t like having the line-lengths predetermined
| by fixed verse forms. It\'s an interim solution. I write in prose but
| think in poetry.*

|
| I took editor to one side and had a quiet word with him. This is for
| my own good, I whispered, and proceeded to disable his editorial
| tools, lopping off his hands, extracting his tongue, etc. He seemed
| to understand and, as I now read it, thanked me profusely with his
| lolling head and rolling eyes. Then I began to practise my fiddling,
| keeping an eye on his writhing body while folding, turning one word
| into another the way dough is turned before being given time to rise.
| I dredge up the analogy (more fiddling) with a tinge of regret, even
| shame, for bread is my favourite food in all the world---I suppose I
| would kill for it---and to mention editor in the same breath as bread
| seems almost blasphemous; ah, but I remember there\'s a limit to
| words and it\'s just been reached. So let\'s step back a step,
| retract that near-blasphemous breath, inhale deeply, say: I fiddle is
| to say I scribble within the confines of my own space, despite the
| neighbours\' persistent complaints about the screeching and
| scratching, their calling in the police who, in any event, are
| powerless to stop me fiddling when I explain that the noise is just a
| scribbling, a turning of one word into another in the manner of
| kneading dough, careful to point out that I\'m not inciting any
| revolutionary acts by invoking the analogy and, at the same time,
| carefully keeping editor out of view lest he give the wrong
| impression or, perhaps, because I\'m ashamed of him. Upon leaving the
| police shake my hand---I\'ve always had a way with the police, as one
| has with children or animals---and I resume my fiddling. Editor is
| hurt, professionally and physically, and since this has just been
| established as his necessary condition, we are now both faced with a
| steep learning curve which we need to get used to, each in his own
| way.
| 
| I am no virtuoso, it must be said, and fiddle only because I\'m
| curious; my fiddling is spurred on by a vague desire to discover the
| new sounds rather than improve or polish the old ones. That\'s not to
| say I don\'t appreciate the old ones, much in the way editor does,
| but it\'s not enough to fulfil my desire. Editor, in contrast, has a
| way of expunging the new sounds with a stroke of his pen, somewhat
| like an abortionist, fossilizing them before they ever take flight.
| He believes my desire is misguided, that there is a better way of
| channeling and controlling it, that it should be put to better use.
| While he was fit and able he\'d always wanted to have a virtuoso at
| hand (forgive the expression) and had dreamed of making me one of his
| own. Ah, but there are too many virtuosos, cried Robert Schumann,
| spitting on the polished parquet floor. Editor is confounded by the
| riposte. I can see his mangled body, thinking: surely you mean
| virtuosi. He is certainly not humming a melody inside his head,
| because as I snatched the pen and disabled him I discovered, to my
| shock, indeed my shame (after all, he is/was my editor), nothing in
| his internal makeup remotely connected with music. Instead there were
| millions of micro-blueprints stacked on top of each other, slightly
| curled at the edges like wafers, each bearing the imprint of some
| formula for a melody, past or present or future: all nuts and bolts
| and intricate scaffolding, which in its way presented a dazzling
| construction that any virtuoso would have given his right arm to play
| (forgive the expression), but without the slightest indication of
| what voice or tone or timbre such melodies might be borne upon. In
| fact, a moment before disabling him I informed editor that there are
| no more virtuosos in the world, only students, and to my surprise
| (and eased conscience) he seemed more relieved than disturbed by the
| news. I was not telling him the whole truth, of course, but our
| relationship is such that it forgoes the elaboration of truth (on my
| part because its structural complexities would be overbearing, while
| on his part the aesthetic and moral dimensions would defy his
| comprehension); rather the smallest grain of truth is often enough to
| maintain the fragile rapport between us. So for the moment editor and
| I live side by side, reconciled to each other\'s exclusionary habits;
| I fiddling, he nodding his wobbling head, keeping time for the sake
| of appearances. Occasionally, when our respective tasks come full
| circle and we turn a mutual glance of recognition towards each other,
| we will take a break together over a cup of coffee or a glass of
| wine, our dreams oozing incoherently from the corners of our mouths,
| dripping like bird shit on the cafe table, as life flows to and fro
| on the pavement before our eyes---his, like mine, darting back and
| forth with unabashed lust as one young woman or another comes into
| view---only to have our little reveries promptly interrupted by a
| waitress asking, \"Are you all right, sir?\" So that I\'m forced to
| look up and around me, awkwardly, desperately. Editor has suddenly
| absconded and left me to answer her simple query. In a futile attempt
| to grasp a pen with my mouth and scribble \"yes\" on any scrap of
| paper, I have, not for the first time in my life, accidentally
| overturned the table and chairs. Remorse for my reprehensible
| behaviour towards editor momentarily seizes me, and a shameful tear
| is about to fill my eye as the waitress, brimming with kindness and
| efficiency, comforts me: \"Don\'t worry, sir, it\'s all right.\"
| Dutifully she bends down and shuffles on all fours as she cleans up
| the mess around my truncated legs; her breasts, liberally exposed to
| my parched and crippled gaze, sway slightly with her scrubbing
| movements, as if to say: drink, drink my compassion, o scribbler.
| 
| As a student of fiddling I am prone to daydreaming, especially when I
| practise my bowing and fingering, which I do religiously yet by all
| accounts hopelessly, for whether I practise once a week or every day
| of the week, whether I fiddle on street corners or in cafés or in the
| privacy of my room, the result is always, acoustically speaking, a
| scribble. It has to do with distraction, of course, and the
| enticement offered up by an image of loveliness passing by on the
| street, in a café, or across the walls of my room. Oh, but I like
| that, remarks a progressive tutor, a specialist on expressionism, his
| ear ever alert to the permutations of the new sounds. Annoyingly, I
| must watch my posture at all times---me, a cripple, watch my
| posture!---make sure my eye-line does not stray too far from the
| strings, and always keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. Such,
| at least, were the rules given at the outset, when I was a mere
| sub-scribe, long before I became a student, and although I\'m now at
| post-graduate level the same rules still apply, the cardinal one
| among them being \"never drift into mindless reverie.\" The trick, as
| another tutor advised us, is to dream without affecting a dreamer\'s
| countenance, to cast one\'s mind off in some direction while the
| (very same) mind stays focused, enrapt by the intricacies of the
| hands\' manoeuvres. As you can see, I haven\'t given up yet, perhaps
| because I\'ve noticed that over the years tutors come and go, experts
| become fallible, if not completely discredited, histories get
| revised, wars start up and arrive at their conclusions, stores change
| ownership, buildings get torn down and re-built, and things generally
| move on---whereas scribbling just evaporates into the atmosphere like
| so much vacuous sighing and, despite its noxious fusion with the air
| we breathe, is accepted as just another waste product with a
| tolerable, low-level health risk, no more dangerous than the toxins
| given off by other human wastes. The fact that nobody pays any
| attention to it, however, could prove tragically fatal under certain
| circumstances---for example, if a scribbler were to be retroactively
| regarded as talented, even a genius, and we, human kind, belatedly
| berated ourselves for having been so deaf, so blind, and beat our
| breasts with futile lamentations, and tore each others\' hearts out
| with proprietary fingernails, and waged suicidal wars in the name of
| said dead scribbler, now canonised, his or her pen emblazoned on the
| national pennant billowing proudly over our burning libraries, day
| and night, etc. But in the case of students, even at post-graduate
| level, such potential catastrophes are highly improbable, as unlikely
| as a cataclysmic end of days, so there\'s really no need to fret, no
| need to get anxious over our performance, no need (or indeed desire)
| to seek encouragement from our peers or advice from experts, because
| scribbling is merely a process, nothing more, a perpetual practice
| session with or without a fiddle, and in any case, as otologists have
| shown, the human ear\'s threshold for noise rises by the hour, edging
| nearer to a level of infinity with every exclamation, every grunt and
| moan, every scratch or tap of the finger, with every etched
| apostrophe or comma on a blank page. As one of our most distinguished
| tutors put it: *Our potential capacity to listen to everything will
| shake the foundations of our belief systems to their core.* I was
| thinking, as it happened, about the word as the foundation of faith
| (not my original thought, just pondering an old one) when he added:
| *It\'s something we should consider with the utmost gravity and
| tackle with a measured rationality.* I think he was soft peddling
| doom, imploring us to reinstate a more humane threshold for the
| ear\'s intake of noise before it\'s too late. Too late for what, I
| wanted to ask, eager to join the debate. But being a cripple, being
| doomed to my studies, playing uncontrollably with my fiddle, I would
| have been unable to get my point across to him, over there, on stage,
| behind the podium, without upsetting the furniture and provoking a
| riot. All the same, upon leaving I reflected that despite my
| restraint it was an interesting outing for a bleak winter\'s
| afternoon, and I went away believing that my knowledge had increased
| by two- or threefold.
| 
| Although I\'m sometimes mistaken for a cripple, sometimes I\'m not.
| It is therefore just as true to say that I am as that I am not a
| cripple, and it\'s a matter of political interpretation whether you
| believe one or the other of these truths. My identity as a scribbler
| has not been affected one way or the other in this respect, but this
| is probably due to the perverse social conventions of our time. In
| the old days they would have certified me, put me in a safe place
| behind walls for my own good, and said no more about the matter;
| invisible, I would have been perceived as either happy or unhappy.
| Today our techniques are more subtle and sophisticated, especially in
| the free world, where we take pride in the fact that we can air these
| issues openly and hold interesting debates at our local cafés or on
| television or occasionally even on a bus, on the way home from work,
| though that is still somewhat rare owing to our collective fatigue
| after work. But those of us who don\'t work, who are less weary, will
| not hesitate to launch into such democratic debate if we should come
| upon a fellow non-worker on the bus, even heading home at 5 a.m.
| after an all-night party, just when our fellow workers are setting
| off to work on that bus, though they may not be sufficiently awake to
| participate in the debate and are possibly too preoccupied with their
| night\'s dreams, reconstructing the details, thinking of plausible
| explanations for implausible events, half-consciously tying together
| random associations in their minds, their hands struggling to support
| their drooping yawning heads, their bleary eyes peering into the
| pre-dawn darkness as they silently ask themselves what does this or
| that object mean in that incongruous setting, among such unlikely
| people, and is the dream object connected with the real thing they
| stumbled upon only a few days earlier, after not having seen the
| likes of it for years, their brains persistently searching through
| this miasma of vague objects and people for some kind of solution, a
| key, as if these freshly painted dreams were riddles that only needed
| the correct answer to facilitate a stress-free day at work and allow
| them to confront their superiors with the confidence of people who
| know themselves, whose selves have been revealed to them in dreams,
| regardless of how menial their jobs might be and irrespective of
| their professional status, their pecuniary position, their grooming
| or their physical appearance in general---it being their democratic
| prerogative, theoretically, to be themselves in any guise they
| choose---because they saw the light through the dusk and, having
| opted out of a now raging democratic debate, heard a voice in the
| wilderness and were born again on the upper deck of the bus at 5a.m.,
| en route to work. I know all this for a fact because, having
| participated in that democratic debate, I witnessed their revelations
| with my own eyes and quickly scribbled everything down while it was
| all fresh in my mind, when their dreams were far less obscure than
| they are today.
| 
| Since then reverie has been my precise goal, and my fiddling studies
| are only a means of dealing with the pragmatic side of other
| dreamers\' dreams. One fine day, as we return from our afternoon
| ritual of ogling nymphs on the banks of the boulevard, editor and I
| will come upon a list of words posted on our door, with a set of
| instructions to consider their place in my scribbling. Editor is keen
| to proceed, sensing an opportunity to regain the high ground in our
| relationship, but I remind him of our pact and avert his deployment
| for the time being. He is all but dead, a mere copyist, but I too am
| suddenly paralysed by a bout of amnesia, my lifelong years of study
| failing me miserably. Conscientiously I copy the list into my
| computer and it comes out like this:
| 
| Shame
| 
| The private
| 
| The secret in narrative writing
| 
| Representations of time
| 
| Event
| 
| Expectation (the future) in narrative
| 
| My computer (or rather its editor) automatically capitalizes the
| first word in each line---not what I expected, but I leave it as it
| is. I imagine the software writer will claim responsibility, perhaps
| a former poet eager to accommodate traditional verse writers. But,
| capitalized or not, the words are easily comprehensible, so I feel at
| least partially redeemed by my scribbling studies, imagining that any
| reader would understand them: the typography and size of a word has
| no bearing on its meaning, I remind editor, though it may be argued
| there\'s a difference in degree. Though I would have preferred the
| initial words without capitals, it seems pointless (and too
| difficult) to change them now. (Perhaps in future the software
| writer, a being of necessity in the future, will include an
| instruction that would allow the computer\'s editor to distinguish
| between a list of items and lines of verse; perhaps another
| instruction might be added that would allow its editor to discern a
| writer\'s intended nuance for a given word, or line, and
| automatically capitalise such words---for example, \"life\" as typed
| in by an immortal\'s fingers.) But this is beside the point. The
| point is I don\'t understand why or how language and writing coexist,
| though I understand and to some extent sympathize with the historical
| expediencies that have conjoined them. But how, after so many
| thought-bearing hours in such claustrophobic proximity, have they
| failed to find their separate autonomous domains? Have they just
| grown used to each other and learned to be mutually tolerant? Have
| they gone a step further (backwards, it seems) and learned to
| coexist, perhaps even to love each other in our thought processes? If
| that were so---though I don\'t for a moment believe it---why? what
| for? We scribble, day in, day out. If we advance, writing lies in
| wait, ready to devour us; if we retreat, language stabs us in the
| back. Would it not be better if we had neither---no language, no
| writing---if there were no scribbling, no anti-scribbling, no pauses
| and deliberations over their duration, if everything were simply a
| constant torrent of some alien construct pouring into the well of
| truth, that shameless metaphor born from the union of language and
| writing. I\'m not alone in this my bafflement. My incomprehension is
| borne out by the writers I read, writers who have nothing to do with
| language, who don\'t know the meaning of the word, writers as removed
| from representations of time, event, expectation and futures as Greek
| shards, who have as little idea about shame, the private, the secret
| in writing as that extrovert Yaweh, who have never even heard of a
| narrative concept. Those writers I read, those are the writers I
| write, that is, those writers I re-write; that\'s why they write and
| why I write, why we, they and I, write, tuning our scribbling fiddles
| to a sorrowful pitch. Editor reads the very same writers I write, and
| yet invariably incinerates their pages, marking every word for
| approval before burning them, and sometimes adding a last-minute
| grammatical correction in his head. But editor reads only what has
| already been written, texts, what may never be re-written, that\'s
| impossible, what may only be read over and over and over. Whereas I
| and the writers I read write only to re-write each other and will not
| allow ourselves, for our verbs are many, to be re-written otherwise,
| distracted by a shopping list of contingencies with moral and
| historical imperatives, since we\'re ambitious to succeed our
| scribbling with our failure. That shopping list belongs in my pocket.
| It is revealed (like a furtive cigarette in the street) when I go
| shopping and use language as a counter, when I\'m talking face to
| face, seeking out your immediate reply, my lips smacking each other,
| my jaws moving like pincers, my tongue slithering between movements
| of jaws and lips, my vocal chords dilating or contracting like
| synchronized swimmers, my lungs and every other pertinent organ
| acting in time and with deceptive ease to allow me to articulate
| something or other, this or that. Thus we talk and act, sometimes
| sequentially, sometimes synchronously. The articulation of our bones,
| as well as what we concoct with language, says something about our
| life, in death, after the flesh has rotted away and the worms have
| moved to another body, yet language itself can never exhume the
| writing that went on (perhaps on a daily basis) before the final
| heartbeat. While the writer, o scribbler, is steeped in shame, in
| some perverse privacy or in the self\'s profoundest secret, the body
| of writing is perpetuated in its own skin, marking out its own
| as-ifness the way silence delineates the borders of language. Let us
| admit, let\'s say, that I have murdered you and am now stricken with
| remorse, dumb with shame and crippled by guilt; whatever I\'ve done,
| whatever else I\'m doing, I am not writing. I am outside the writing,
| doomed to carry in my language as author some pitiful mental
| inflammation throbbing with a succession of phonemes, each in turn
| having been orphaned by its murderous language, the same that suckled
| it, that gave it comfort in the face of silence. Which is all well
| and good, is as it should be in the realm of as-if, but as the
| writing proceeds what if, scribbling, it revealed itself in some
| sacred alphabet, a revelation earmarked as a future holy text, as
| though writing were shame and privacy and secrecy itself, to be
| divulged in our death? And what if that as-if were an angel,
| classical, orthodox, with the power to unleash language\'s ultimate
| terror---though I and the writers I re-write don\'t know what that
| might be---would editor allow it to fulfil its divine mission, or
| would he intervene and, effectively, overthrow the lord in our
| household? Such questions seem infinitely difficult when, of an
| afternoon, editor and I return from viewing the maidens by the river,
| slightly tipsy from their beauty.
| 
| I like, I say to him before reaching our door, a poetry that is
| definitive in its ambiguities, but cannot be as passionate about it
| as I am about a poetry of ambiguous definitions. Reaching for the
| list of words on the door, he calls me a hypocrite.
| 
| I was so ashamed that, if writing were language, \"so\" would never
| survive under the burden it claims to support, for shame draws us
| back through time, as even the earliest scribblers evoking Paradise
| were at pains to point out, and during that interregnum every act of
| love and war perpetrated by the species has accrued to its surface.
| Since writing is not language, however, it is easy to articulate the
| so of it, to say it or spell it or memorize it for future use. And I
| hid, editor confessed to me once, for I was so naked.
| 
| The nonsense we tolerate, I confessed back to him in a moment of
| compassion, is nothing compared to the nonsense we produce,
| especially when the latter is predicated by a collective pronoun and
| dressed, how can I put it---I paused, I scratched---aphoristically?
| he offered.
