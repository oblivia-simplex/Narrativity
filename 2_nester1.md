| **Working Notes:**                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| *\"Mr. Narrator, this is Bob Dylan to me.\" D. Boon, The Minutemen,   |
| \"History Lesson-Part II\"*                                           |
|                                                                       |
| *In June 2000, I had a crisis. In a club called \"Fun,\" an dank,     |
| empty club deep in Chinatown, I sat down for an interview for the VH1 |
| show SoundAffects, and talked about how Queen changed my life.*       |
|                                                                       |
| *I left so much out in that interview that I tried to write more      |
| poems about Queen, but hit a wall. Call it problems with              |
| verisimilitude, whatever it was, poems weren\'t doing the trick.*     |
|                                                                       |
| *So I started writing a confessional book, freeing myself from what I |
| think are very real aesthetic contraints on today\'s poem. The result |
| is a kind of prose poem, with narration leading to definitive moments |
| where I think my history and the object of my obsession\'s            |
| history-and I say this with a straight face-intersect.*               |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| The day I bought the *Flash Gordon* soundtrack, the cashier, whom I   |
| knew to be in a shitty suburban punk band, offered me my first record |
| store clerk snide comment.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| \"Nice bass line,\" he said, looking down at the banana yellow album  |
| on the counter, punching up the price.                                |
|                                                                       |
| I walked away, meek and ashamed that my purchase had not passed       |
| muster. He was, of course, referring to the single-note bass line in  |
| \"Flash\'s Theme,\" the single from on the soundtrack. But I was      |
| steamed. It was one of those times you think of with the perfect      |
| comeback later that night, and you lay there, beating yourself up for |
| not coming up with it at the time.                                    |
|                                                                       |
| In 1977, when Queen were recording *The News Of The World,* legend    |
| has it that the Sex Pistols were recording in an adjacent studio. Sid |
| Vicious, wandering into the wrong room, as was his custom, came upon  |
| Freddie Mercury, sitting at a piano. His customary four fingers of    |
| vodka in hand.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| \"Ah, Freddie Mercury,\" Sid said, proud of his recognition.          |
| \"Bringing ballet to the masses then?\"                               |
|                                                                       |
| Freddie looked up from the keys, and, not missing a beat, offered his |
| reply.                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| \"Oh yes, Mister Ferocious. Well, we\'re doing our best, my dear.\"   |
|                                                                       |
