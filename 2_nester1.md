**In June 2000**, I had a crisis. In a club called \"Fun,\" an dank,
empty club deep in Chinatown, I sat down for an interview for the VH1
show SoundAffects, and talked about how Queen changed my life.

I left so much out in that interview that I tried to write more
poems about Queen, but hit a wall. Call it problems with
verisimilitude, whatever it was, poems weren\'t doing the trick.

So I started writing a confessional book, freeing myself from what I
think are very real aesthetic contraints on today\'s poem. The result
is a kind of prose poem, with narration leading to definitive moments
where I think my history and the object of my obsession\'s
history-and I say this with a straight face-intersect.

## God Save My Queen (The Freddie Fragments)

The day I bought the *Flash Gordon* soundtrack, the cashier, whom I
knew to be in a shitty suburban punk band, offered me my first record
store clerk snide comment.

\"Nice bass line,\" he said, looking down at the banana yellow album
on the counter, punching up the price.

I walked away, meek and ashamed that my purchase had not passed
muster. He was, of course, referring to the single-note bass line in
\"Flash\'s Theme,\" the single from on the soundtrack. But I was
steamed. It was one of those times you think of with the perfect
comeback later that night, and you lay there, beating yourself up for
not coming up with it at the time.

In 1977, when Queen were recording *The News Of The World,* legend
has it that the Sex Pistols were recording in an adjacent studio. Sid
Vicious, wandering into the wrong room, as was his custom, came upon
Freddie Mercury, sitting at a piano. His customary four fingers of
vodka in hand.

\"Ah, Freddie Mercury,\" Sid said, proud of his recognition.
\"Bringing ballet to the masses then?\"

Freddie looked up from the keys, and, not missing a beat, offered his
reply.

\"Oh yes, Mister Ferocious. Well, we\'re doing our best, my dear.\"


## *Prophet\'s Song*


| Chunky on the shag rug
| I\'m looking for my anthem
| I\'m looking for my headphones
| I\'m looking for the bare spot
| On the rug to wallow side-
| Stepped on the chair-stopped
| Door, and as I blast my ears
| Out with *A Night at the Opera,*
| I\'m looking at pictures of you
| My catholic princes, my mother
| Father proxy, I\'m in London
| With you now, the koi pond, the flamingo,
| The statues, the hymnal,
| The Aretha Franklin song at the funeral,
| Alone on a pew, watching the water,
| Watching the bare spot on the rug
| Filled with pictures on the floor,
| I\'m ignoring the knocks on the door
| I\'m ignoring the knocks on the door
| Stepped and stripped on the chair-
| Stopped door, I\'m listening, listening.

The Elektra butterfly, an indicia, the small caps Helvetica bold      
font, the import Parlophones, their spare blank small writing. Those  
first few moments playing the English 12-inch singles, fresh from the 
thick plastic seal, realizing the beginning is too slow, that you     
have to switch the RMP knob from 33 to 45. The silence between the    
songs, readjusting in my chair, preparing for the first listen.       
Rooting for them, noting who wrote which track, soaking up the        
essence of each of them while listening to their song. And the order, 
the plot that album took, the lead-off rocker, the last song on side  
2\'s power ballad. The internal band politics I imagined in the       
making of that order. The Greek lettering in a concentric dance on    
the cheapo compilations.

When I think of the 1980s, when I think of the skinny ties, and the   
big hair, teal drawstring pants, and Ronald Reagan, I think of Queen, 
of course, and how, shifting to their big synthesizer singles, they   
would graft a medley of past songs on the end of extended versions.   
Or how their videos for these songs had montage footage of concerts   
all over the world, all of which I found lame. I\'ve come up with     
three possible reasons:                                               

1. A retrospective impulse, not provided by the rock literary        
establishment.                                                        

2. New digital tinkering, combined with a desire to make             
connections within their own work, combined with the finest cocaine   
and vodka human beings can afford, a few way overdue divorces, and    
a general lack of interest in the current song at hand, pressure      
from EMI and Capitol to pad out singles with no non-album B-sides.    

3. Because they can. They\'re Queen, the greatest fucking rock band  
there ever was or ever will be, and they can do whatever the hell     
they want.

Sometimes I feel the need to summon the ghosts of the 70s crowds
around me, or maybe they come to me. These ghosts appear as people I
meet by chance, people who actually saw Queen in concert.

Adding insult to injury, these people usually have seen them, like,
four, five times. I\'ll corner them, say, at a barbeque, ask
him---it\'s always a guy---a battery of questions.

\'What songs do you remember,\' or, \'What was Freddie wearing\"
might be lead-offs. I move on to set lists, how they sounded.
Inevitably, these people tire of my inquiries, and run back to their
wives.

Once I bought a cherry copy of *Live Killers* at a church yard sale
in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The man who was selling them
also had a box set, *The Complete Prestige Recordings of Miles
Davis.* Got it for ten dollars. The Queen album cost 50 cents.

My new copy of *Live Killers,* the one with all four members onstage,
with arms raised receiving adulation from the crowd, had four photos
inserted inside one of the albums\' slots. I remembered how I used to
stick girly photos inside an album I had designated for this purpose,
to retrieve them in private moments.

The dates on the back of the photos were 1979, the year the album
came out. In one picture, a guy is grabbing a blonde girl\'s bare
tits from behind, cupping them. In another, the same guy, his faint
brown mustache rides an ear-to-ear smile. His pants are completely
down. The third and fourth document the amount of coke the two had in
their private basement party. Both the boy and girl smiling, each
taking a turn snorting three and four-inch lines.

The way I find out about someone seeing Queen in concert is the
following. After my meek confession of my love for the band, after a
longer conversation about music, there\'s a set-up for the other
person to mention his own guilty generational pleasure. For instance,
he liked Styx at one time, he saw Journey once on the Escape tour.
Then, my reasoning goes, the path is made for me to say that my
favorite band is not some hip or critically acclaimed band, either;
that it is, in fact, Queen. It\'s like I\'m outing myself, and then
the guy--- always a guy---tries to console me, tells me about the
times he had seen Queen at concert. Then, I get to ask the battery of
questions. It\'s a safe framing for the information that I
mythopoetically need to hear. \"They rocked the Garden or wherever,\"
or \"they blew my mind, man,\" while off-hand remarks for some, is
music to my ears.

During one easy-going outing/concert re-creation session, I brought
up these found photos I found in the yard sale copy of *Live
Killers.* I was trying to spice up the conversation. I told him about
the pictures---the girl\'s tits, the guy\'s pants completely down,
the smiling pictures, the coke. We both laughed. I excused myself,
offering to buy him a drink at the bar.

When I came back to our seats, my recollect or muse had gone.

As if in my own benediction ceremony, I would lay out all of the
Queen albums, flush next to each other, in order of release, on my
bedroom floor. The 45s from each album would lay on top of them, in
the lower right-hand corner, also in order of release, from bottom to
top. I would then stand in front of this, drinking a wine cooler, as
if I were Noah in the *Ten Commandments* movie, congratulatorily
clasping my arms behind my back, as if this was my ark, my own
creation; that I had, through my sheer accumulation and arrangement
of these objects, some part of creating them. Actually, back then, I
am sure that I thought I had created them, at least in the form of
the configuration I was looking at, and the Bartles & James tasted
sweet going down my throat, and with my room clean and vacuumed, I
would lay on my bed, jerking off.



## Denial

| It was at the Queenvention
| summer of \'91
| when I met the old ladies
| with the pasty photo albums
| old 45s pressed binders
| videotapes stuffing their purses.
| We sat in hotel rooms
| off the northeast extension
| and drank Pennsylvania
| wine, admired Freddie Mercury
| and Brian in the lights
| of their hometowns, smelled
| Roger\'s real tiger skin trousers.
| What we didn\'t know.
| A hotel caterer grabs me
| in the video room, she shakes me,
| really, and asks *What in God\'s name
| is this?* I ask back: Haven\'t you heard
| crazy little thing called love? *Oh, yeah,*
| she says. *They still around?*
| I pull her aside
| to make sure the Russians
| don\'t hear her. We look
| at the new pictures, the ones
| with the thin body draped
| with thick sweatshirts.
| *Will they ever tour again?*
| asks one. And I was always
| of the consoling mind,
| defining God by what he doesn\'t do.
| His impotence is His mercy,
| and so forth. This, however,
| didn\'t wash with the ladies
| of the Holiday Inn. *He\'s just
| getting skinny, is all.*
| We danced that night,
| haunted by the snapshots,
| we hugged, huddled
| round the boombox
| for the message from London.
| How they wished
| they all could be there.
| The proud ladies and I retire.

Am I the biggest Queen fan? Certainly not. When I joined the Queen
International Fan Club in 1982, the newsletters were full of pictures
of fan club conventions, thousands of people taking weekend vacations
to watch videos, play trivia games, play tug-of-war, trade rare 45s.
All of this happened in exotic locations-Belgium, South America,
Brighton. Anywhere but America, it seemed. So I kept to myself with
my collection of 12 albums, 20 singles, and the few American rock
magazines that mentioned Queen at all. Then I would go out high
school parties, listen to Van Halen, new wave, Blondie 45s, Billy
Joel, and Phil Collins, as if that was the outside world, and my room
was another.

One afternoon in 1984, when my parents were out, I called the Fan
Club in London, using the phone number from the album jacket of *The
Works.* Ostensibly, I wanted to ask about my membership renewal, but
I also wanted to talk to someone else who actually liked my favorite
band. I would announce myself---\"Hello from America!\" ---ask the
man who answers about the weather, if a band member had been around
that day. *Of course they hadn\'t,* I thought to myself, scoldingly.
But of course I had to ask: *the man on the phone being so much
closer to them.* Getting down to business, I inquire about my poster
and new fan club newsletter, which I had yet to receive.

I say something about how I feel like I\'m the only fan in America.

\"Would be nice to live in England, where everyone\'s a fan,\" I say,
mopingly. \"Well,\" the English-accented man says on the other end.
\"We did have another person from America send something in,\" he
says off-handedly.

\"Really!\" I say. I am excited, panting. \"Who?\"

This could be someone I could correspond with, without running up my
parent\'s phone bill. Maybe, just maybe, it was a woman, killing two
birds with one stone: my love life and my cultural exile.

He looks up the person. \"Yes,\" he said, flipping through papers.
\"And that person\...that person\...is\...*you*.\"

Both of us paused at this, the brutal, Spinal Tap pity of this, the
newest single, \"Hammer to Fall,\" failing to even dent the charts in
the U.S.

I don\'t think I ever felt so alone.
