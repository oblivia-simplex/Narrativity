# Flange or Premises

Mary Burger


Can I say it went on for a week. Can I say I woke up each day, and
went through each day,

\"You were there, and you were there, and you, and you!\"

Word went out, a consciousness with a consistency, looked at itself
looking at itself, halted the infinite regress, the mirror facing the
mirror, a language made possible a belief in location.

I wanted to speak as someone who had experiences. I wanted to speak as
someone who knew others. To have things happen, and to speak of them,

someone told a story to which I was unable to respond. The story was
the story itself.

 

I want the other thing. Hinges and holes and string. The impossible
appearing to be,

an engine, a large machine, an apparatus, a stage for a scene.

 

Can it be a narrator who doubts its premises?

The crumbling, if something will, whom it will happen to.

As what happens then, if what happens is always something more.
