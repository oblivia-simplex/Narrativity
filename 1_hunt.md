_In my skull is an avenue I stroke_[^huntA]

*Clark Coolidge*

 

There is an avenue in my skull too---albeit one that is poorly
maintained, cavernously pitted, strewn with rubble, whole segments
blasted away; one that is curved, possibly circular, that, like the
backgrounds in cartoons, maddeningly repeats itself; one that is
ill-marked, with many a false turn-off and many a false vista; one
that is skewed out of proportion, that is frequently unsafe, almost
always unsavory; one that is troubled by converging lanes, of which
there are hundreds, that even resembles a parking lot in places and is
probably haunted---_hell of a place_[^huntB]. And yet, [I,
narrator][^huntC], stroke it, speak through its mess, speak of its
mess, multiply it. It\'s an interesting dilemma---aspects of which are
taken up in Adorno\'s seminal essay on the place of the narrator in
the contemporary novel---the narrator, with no story to narrate,
_narrates anyway_[^huntD], a story that has been blown to bits. Of
course not everyone sees it that way. We live in [an age of errata, of
misinformation, of disinformation, of hoax][^huntE]; perhaps it is
little wonder that there continues to be such a hunger for narratives
that, as Adorno describes them, largely by way of 19th century
techniques _mimic the real_[^huntF]; that say to us, with
disarming earnestness, this, my friends, is _how it was_[^huntG].
In the domain of the fictive narrative, I tend to have little patience
for such works. I am much more interested in (and seem only capable of
constructing) narratives that are to some degree aware of _the
provisional nature of their own authority_[^huntH], in which _the
fictive quality of recollection_[^huntI] is acknowledged, in which
_forgetting_[^huntJ] is considered the key constituent of memory,
and in which, finally, getting it right shares center stage with
getting it wrong.

 

 

[^huntA]:  Clark Coolidge, **The Crystal Text** (I think). It seems likely I might be alone in seeing in these eight words, words ripped right out of their context, a possible model for narrative.


[^huntB]:  For some years now Brenda Coultas, in her narratives, has been conjuring worlds to which multiple qualities of the preceding description might apply. Whether in her book **Early Films** (Rodent Press 1996) or in her recent chapbook **A Summer Newsreel** (Second
Story Books, 1999) Coultas is engaged in constructing usefully
disjunctive, lyric-enhanced investigations into landscapes that have
come apart. For me, part of the great thing about Coultas\' writing is
that she brings an indomitable hunger for beauty to bear on her
cracked and spilling subjects.


[^huntC]:   E.g., Pamela Lu\'s terrific **Pamela: A Novel** (Atelos, 1998). A bildungsroman of sorts, an intricate chronicle of the coming awake of a highly-syntaxed consciousness, in which the greater part of the narrative seems to occur in between commas.


[^huntD]:  \"The expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express.\" Samuel Beckett (in 1949 conversation with Georges Duthuit).
 

[^huntE]:   
The tendered premise in a recent episode of the X-Files: since World
War Two Americans have had an unquenchable appetite for \'bogus
revelation\'; having determined this, the United States Government has
built, presumably as a cover for its more radical weapons of mass
destruction programs, an elaborate web of alien abduction and sighting
hoaxes. This hoax, we are led to believe, may or may not be one. At
the end, intrigued to a ghastly degree, we are left both believing
(the elements of documentary inherent in the X-Files aiding this
process) that there are aliens around and that the Government has
cooked up (and deployed) weapons even more diabolical than the ones it
has copped to. This tv \'fiction\' seems to me only slightly less
credible than what the evening news, reporting live from the White
House! serves up, or than the gamut of what can be found gathered up
daily in **The New York Times**. (The day after watching the X-Files
episode I read allegations by Puerto Rican petitioners at the United
Nations that the United States Government was testing uranium-capped
bullets at its facility on Vieques Island; during the debate an Iraqi
delegate stated that similar weapons had been used during the Gulf
War.)


[^huntF]: 
Harry Mathews, who, in part of his work, has vertiginously built upon
(see **The Conversions and Tlooth**, recently reissued by Dalkey
Archive), the wonderful, strange narratives of Raymond Roussel, had
this to say in a recent interview in Rain Taxi: \"The great discovery
I made through him \[Roussel\] was that you didn\'t have to write
about what happened the day you fell in the swimming pool, but that
you could invent your own swimming pool that had never existed before,
full of quicksilver, lighted by imaginary lamps.\" Which, abstracted,
might lead to a formula something like, The writer is in the world;
the writing is in the writer. Or, looking at it from a reader-oriented
perspective, we might arrive at: The writing is in the reader; the
reader is in the world; Either way we are dealing with a considerable
degree of mediation. One I am interested in.



[^huntG]: 
\"The more strictly the novel adheres to realism in external things,
to the gesture that says \'this is how it was,\' the more every word
becomes a mere \'as if,\' and the greater becomes the contradiction
between this claim and the fact that it was not so.\"\ (Adorno, \"The Position of the Narrator in the Contemporary Novel\")



[^huntH]: 
Among contemporary works, the narratives of W.G. Sebald (**The
Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn**) are exemplary in this regard,
pointing up, as they do, against the backdrop of this bloody century
(and with an apercu of others), the enormous difficulty of fixing
experience, both personal and collective. Keith Waldrop\'s harrowing
memoir **Light While There Is Light** (which calls itself fiction) is
another example. As is David Markson\'s intriguing **Wittgenstein\'s
Ladder**.





[^huntI]: 
Ryonusuke Akutagawa brilliantly treats aspects of this in a pair of
stories which were later combined and made into the much more famous
film **Rashomon** by Akira Kurosawa. Aaron Shurin writes, in passing,
in his 1990 essay \"Narrativity," of the \'irreversible solidity of
the past tense.\' I\'ve lately begun to marvel, because of this
generally ascribed quality, that History continues to be written in
it. It was Herodotus, Father of History, who kicked things
off---neatly blending directly observed incident/object with reported
incident/object with rumored incident/object with imagined
incident/object. At least a good part of what gets built into the past
tense, then, is hardly irreversible, hardly solid. Pretty slippery, in
fact.




[^huntJ]:  
Walter Benjamin writes beautifully on this in the opening pages of his
essay, "The Image of Proust" (**Illuminations**): "For the important
thing for the remembering author is not what he experienced, but the
weaving of his memory, the Penelope work of recollection. Or should
one call it, rather, a Penelope work of forgetting? Is not the
involuntary recollection, Proust\'s memoire involuntaire, much closer
to forgetting than what is usually called memory? And is not this work
of spontaneous recollection, in which remembering is the woof and
forgetting the warf, a counterpart to Penelope\'s work rather than its
likeness? For here the day unravels what the night has woven. When we
awake each morning, we hold in our hands, usually weakly and loosely,
but a few fringes of the tapestry of lived life, as loomed for us by
forgetting. However, with our purposeful activity and, even more, our
purposive remembering each day unravels the web and the ornaments of
forgetting. This is why Proust finally turned his days into nights,
devoting all his hours to undisturbed work in his darkened room with
artificial illumination, so that none of those intricate arabesques
might escape him."
