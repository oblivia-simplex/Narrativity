|                                                                       |
| ^1^, ^1^ Once upon a time a cloud of sobbing strings pretended to     |
| protect the figure of a woman in what was either a song or a          |
| landscape, hovering above her and around her like moonlight and       |
| water, but only in the sense that moonlight serves as the medium for  |
| speculation on nuclear fission ninety million miles away in the       |
| opposite direction, and water acts as a lens, focusing what it covers |
| into a disclosure adding the picturesque to the particular. There had |
| been an episode of some kind, starvation had loomed, she had been     |
| forced, not without some ironic pleasure, it\'s true, to eat the      |
| still-squirming flesh of an Intellectual in Red Bermuda Shorts, among |
| other things. Some of these things were clear, while others remained  |
| titular. Under the titles were texts, lyrics she was engaged to write |
| so that a man named Birdy, no longer young at all, but who saw        |
| himself now as he had been ten or fifteen years ago, solitary and     |
| intransigent and correct in a concrete box that housed a single room, |
| plus toilet and kitchenette, might within those texts produce         |
| disengagements by which the letters would emerge as black designs     |
| against white paper, and behind them, whether reading or hearing them |
| sung accompanied by guitar, the people of this landscape might then   |
| intuit the presence of himself and his Apostrophe - for thus,         |
| tropically, did he continue to think of her - she beautiful and he    |
| evil, or vice versa, or all one way or the other, so long as there    |
| was some sense of distribution implicit in their roles. He identified |
| the luxury sedan in the commercial whose jingle made him think of     |
| her, and bought it with the last of his royalties from a previously   |
| pilfered tune, and named it As Such, driving it around everywhere,    |
| even on rainy indoor days, so that the city and indeed the nation     |
| might fondle the exciting and aerodynamic contour of everything that  |
| was surging within him precisely as it occurred. *And the pleasure of |
| being a lover, of living by love alone, was enhanced in his eyes, as  |
| a dilettante of intangible sensations, by the price he was paying for |
| it[]{#text3}* ^[\[see\ Endnote\]](brady_endnote.html)^.               |

| Apostrophe, watching it all in slo-mo, said to the unidentified       |
| others sitting next to her on the dilapidated couch in the            |
| television\'s blue-tinged glare while the cheap VCR hummed softly,    |
| \"Here\'s the part where he begins to think he\'s outsmarting - who?  |
| not me, even he must have given up anything but the broadest of       |
| analogies in that direction - but someone, nonetheless, who turns her |
| head from side to side, allowing his right hand to drip something     |
| oily and bitter into the balancing mechanisms of her inner ear, while |
| his left buys out her lease. *It becomes possible to cut off the      |
| supply of light from a house.* Look out for the landlord who tells    |
| you he sees through the vanity of possession, for he\'s about to      |
| knock holes in your walls through which later to knock a hole or two  |
| in you.\"                                                             |
