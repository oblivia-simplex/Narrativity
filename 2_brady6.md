| Once upon a time there was a man named Birdy, somewhat younger than   |
| he had been in an episode just a moment previous, who gave the lie to |
| epistemology and remembered the exact contour of every pain his body  |
| had ever suffered through, beaten into shape, even, perhaps           |
| especially, when his mind had been on something else. Sitting in the  |
| dark and hearing, from a door or two down the block, soft blowing on  |
| soprano sax, he experienced someone else\'s clarity out of phase.     |
|                                                                       |
| *\"I was afraid he was going to eat me,\"* a particularly             |
| disingenuous character in the family drama was just then reciting, in |
| rehearsal with the cop with whom, arm in arm, he or she was coming up |
| the walkway of half-buried railroad ties that kept the path from      |
| parking slab to painted steel front door relatively dry and passable  |
| during the summer floods. Of course, since there was no air           |
| conditioner, Birdy had propped the window open earlier in the evening |
| with a stack of crank pamphlet literature, and so heard every word,   |
| but refused on principle to believe in the reality of any of what was |
| said under such circumstances, and was maintained in his condition of |
| exemplary, self-consuming skepticism. By the same token, though his   |
| skull was perforated as proof of the most certain kind, he could not  |
| grant the veracity of reports that told of a mutant, cannibal freak   |
| lying just beneath the surface of the duplex and chewing on the       |
| sleeper\'s head during the sticky night, but maintained that this Mr. |
| Article was, if anything, a fiction of grammar granted temporary      |
| substance by the growing thickness of ideological descriptions of     |
| landscape. Meanwhile the sax was licking lascivious promises into his |
| ear from distant, microscopic horizons, so that, when his one hand    |
| found his other hand scrabbling around his lap in the dark, his first |
| impulse was to turn on the overhead bulb and find a window envelope,  |
| write a check, and mail away his first adjusted payment.              |
|                                                                       |
