| *I had been holding a vase in my hands that now lay shattered on the
| floor. The vase was \"the novel.\" I\'m not sure of the force that
| knocked the whole away from me but I imagine that it was a slow
| accumulation. As I looked down at the pieces, I could not see how
| they ever fit together. In one place lay prose, in another narrative,
| and off to the side, in several, lay the components of fiction. I
| never felt that I was writing \"fiction,\" so I was surprised to see
| it there. What I found more difficult, however, was seeing \"prose\"
| extricated from \"narrative.\"*
|
| *This confused me. Before this moment, I had thought of narrative as
| the trajectory of language, as the direction in which it unfolds, and
| of prose as narrative\'s rawest tone. But as I observed them lying
| there, I saw each independent of the other. I knew that no matter
| what I did, I would be writing narrative, but I could not fathom how
| I wrote prose separate from that. The process is as natural as
| breathing, however this crisis I experienced was emblematic of that
| occasion where we catch ourselves in the mechanics of respiration and
| get caught up in the mystery of that.*

| *for Tisa Bryant*
|
| 
| A friend has pointed out a paralysis this evening, which she has been
| ignoring for some time. The friend has had to ask why certain parts
| of her body don\'t move, why there is failure in her language, why
| she carries this failure in her body, making her body unable to move.
| It is evening when the friend can no longer contain her observation
| and is forced to point to this stillness that makes her a stranger in
| the room.
|
| The friend points to the paralysis.
|
| Our immobile one is sitting quietly in the corner of a room staring
| at a glass of milk, seemingly enmeshed in daydream. There is
| condensation on the glass, an indication that the milk has sat
| unattended for too long.
|
| Earlier, the friend brought the immobile one this milk.
|
| Then paralysis took its form.
|
| -Now she has been made to see her paralysis. It impresses her and
| makes her mad. She and the friend sit in the room mad at the
| paralysis. As the milk grows warm.
|
| The friend looks at the milk and asks to sip it. Our one says,
| please.
|
| Now that the paralysis has been exposed both women stare ravenously
| at the milk.
|
| Both reach for the milk.
|
| \"Now that I\'ve pointed this out to you, can you explain how it got
| there?\"
|
| She answers.
|
| \"Does the measurement, though compelling you into silence, serve the
| companion in anyway? Is a co-habitation possible?\"
|
| Again, she answers, this time with more emphasis on each word.
|
| \"I have known you for ten years,\" the friend says placing her chin
| in her hand, amazed at what she\'s seeing.
