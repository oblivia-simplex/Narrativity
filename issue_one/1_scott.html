      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">MONTREAL, QUEBEC<i>:</i> 

        I return to the site of an old novel. This will not always be a street 

        of failure, even if still playing the former glamour of the seedy. French-language 

        covers of country music are playing on the radio. Men (sit) alone at tables. 

        One with haggard bearded face. His lower jaw (is) toothless. Teeth in 

        dreams = sex. The low fa&ccedil;ades opposite parading peeling tin cornices. 

        An air of stagnation possibly verging on clich&eacute;. I take some verbs 

        out; then put them in again.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">It is the hottest 
        summer ever. Meteorologists are, with divine hindsight, admitting global 
        warming. To escape the heat, I go to a dark afternoon theatre. Where a 
        sassy high school troupe’s performing B&uuml;chner’s <b>Wozeck</b>. The 
        adolescents’ sweet songs juxtaposed on the gloom and violence under, somehow 
        dissolving earlier-decade interpretations foregrounding worn-out existential 
        despair. Crossing a parking lot behind a smoked meat shop, I am thinking 
        a story, to avoid eternally returning (to keep it moving), might be structured 
        thus: an "older" woman writer circulates at a "fringe" theatre festival 
        of young artists. She has lost her love. Feels discombobulated. Nothing. 
        She skirts the crowd asking several 20-year-olds: anything good? She will 
        then string a humiliated (but raunchy) love tale together, interlaying 
        bits of youthful sweetness and anger, representing to her in her present 
        state of emptiness, a more contemporaneously rapid conflation of beginnings 
        and endings. A word about narrative:</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&#9;</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">At another table, 
        a man shakes his purple-shirted shoulders in the hot bar air. To "Caught 
        With Your Pants Down." Drinking straight tequila. The same table where 
        X and I sat. Discussing why our favorite writers of new and experimental 
        fiction are not rich and famous. "Too abject," we say. In a bag at our 
        feet, some cheaply extravagant dollhouse boudoir furniture purchased for 
        her little son. From the store with the saggy awning opposite. Leaving, 
        we forget it. Outside another man passing. With several teeth missing. 
        Teeth = action. But why the narrator (the woman) endlessly remarking. 
        Such toothless ghosts of subjects. Among dozens of better-furbished faces. 
        Is her "local" constructed out of some kind of distancing or bias?* Or 
        "mere" projection of love’s losses? I am thinking <b>not</b> abject the 
        subject. Unless negatively framed. At point of crossing space of (non)-reception 
        between the work and the world. When site (interior)’s signed minor (inadequate). 
        While exterior=dominant. Yet, intrinsic and extrinsic syntax are not separate; 
        rapidly they mate. Should I be happy the lover having sex with no one. 
        If having only virtual sex with me? I take some verbs out. And put them 
        in again. A word about the waitress:</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Dominatrix in clinging 
        leopard-spotted polyester. Small breasts. Ponytail. Fortyish. Saying (in 
        qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois): UN verre de vin-maison ne te ferait pas de mal, 
        one glass of house wine will not ruin the stomach. I.e. it’s terrible. 
        For 75 cents more you can have a quarter liter. Adding: you look en forme, 
        terrific. WE tell each other--in guise of complimenting--we haven't changed 
        in years. I opting for the smallest quantity of red vinegar. Now young 
        woman passing by window. Huge breasts encased in tight halter top. Some 
        little cap over short hair. And&#151;upper incisors gone. Like the meteorologist, 
        I admitting only to coincidence of circumstances. Projecting accumulated 
        lack on unsuspecting bodies. (Waitress bringing unasked for quarter-liter). 
        Which bodies, in being thus sentenced, already frozen in past gesture 
        or alias. While environment drifting elsewhere. As in that restless white 
        river the lover (much later) wanting to attack with kayak. Drifting eternally 
        toward full-color horizons. The silver flashes indicating minor notes 
        of salmon struggling upstream. Sitting close beside her, I encouragingly 
        declaring such projection, battered by tergiversation of context, likely 
        best position. For contemporaneous narrator. Just as lover putting hand 
        under skirt cut on the bias to flare out attractively at the bottom. And 
        saying she still wanting something with "us." A story is something&#151;you 
        can put your teeth into: </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">But what might happen 

        here? With (soon) a closed sign across the window. Two blocks down. A 

        polished glass and marble multi-story, multi-venue, multi-media repertory 

        theatre. Having replaced the crushed blue fa&ccedil;ade of the smoky cozy 

        caf&eacute;-cin&eacute;ma where we used to see old or experimental European 

        French movies. Built by Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois Soft Image inventor Daniel 

        Langlois. We’re like that here: always oscillating between the ultra-modern 

        and the crumbling. The sound system’s so efficient, one feels, listening 

        to the Buena Vista Social Club, as if in some club in crumbling Havana. 

        Though the octogenarian musicians having mostly ceased performing on their 

        blockaded island. Because "nowhere" to go. Until American Ry Cooder choreographing 

        their (global) return. I am thinking of when Qu&eacute;bec liberationists 

        claiming solidarity with Cuba. Which solidarity currently updated to meaning 

        "corporate opportunity." At last, the Cubans playing Carnegie Hall. I 

        am thinking how any narrative, if fronted, marketed from economically 

        preferential geographical site, avoiding being troped as exotically remote, 

        a remoteness that must (paradoxically) scale global walls or languish. 

        I am thinking of Cuban sunsets, suffused towards evening with a little 

        blood. Of the woman’s eye growing humid, sentimental. When, in the movie, 

        the elderly guitarist exclaiming: &quot;There is nothing like a night 

        of love.&quot; To keep it moving, I take some verbs out and put them in 

        again. A word about identity:</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Now the waitress in 
        her leopardskin is leaning over the purple shirt. Who’s reading a sexy 
        men’s magazine. Pausing, he pulls a huge fluorescent flashlight still 
        wrapped in hard plastic cover from a bag. She points out (still speaking 
        [naturellement], French): it’s no good without batteries. Laughing. I 
        can smell him. The conversation segueing to European-French actress Catherine 
        Deneuve. The waitress declaring in drawn-out Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois dipthongs 
        the Europeans looking down on, Deneuve "plate," boring: "Always the same 
        tone." Outside a friend passing by window. Looking for a date. Very strong 
        shoulders. Her long red hair streaming out behind. I know she has latex 
        gloves in her bag. Walking naturally, she "vogues." Causing her to get 
        thrown out of women’s washrooms. For being "wrong" gender. I am thinking 
        how certain minor or unusual demeanors, if flaunted, getting read extrinsically 
        as unappealing or threatening. (In Canada, "Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois" often 
        = flamboyant or risqu&eacute;; coincidentally, same thing for "queer"). 
        This can be devastating. Or interesting. Friend passing again, very feminine 
        in wrap-around skirt, curly red hair. Yet walking as if faking it. I am 
        thinking how narrator (other). IF not knowing how friend herself-self-perceiving, 
        able to create a relationship with reader permitting permutation of both 
        obvious and unspeakable. The body being capable of gestures contrary to 
        understanding. I am thinking about narrator as double. About evening out 
        subject/object weight at each end of sentence. A word about affect:</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">[It has never occurred 

        to me to be a poet. The poet, with rare dazzling exceptions, even when 

        "absent," looms imbricated. In her total fa&ccedil;ade of language. While 

        reader happily at play. In her in sandbox of spaces. Lacking spontaneity, 

        I am drawn to the violence of animation. Experienced by a subject. Drifting 

        towards object. Across the placement of the verb. Which nakedness, exposure, 

        seeming somehow progressive, egalitarian. Yet failing to make woman (narrator) 

        cease obsession with beginnings (causes) and endings (conclusions). So 

        trauma still risking terminating in single unbearable seduction scene. 

        I am thinking of certain literary feminists. Who using devices copped 

        from poetry. To construct porous or unbounded subject. Capable of merging 

        &quot;more&quot; ecologically with context. I am thinking of the gap of 

        the unspeakable. There may be no animal boundary—just the stream and the 

        pleasure that lies in it, teasing the poet.** I am thinking about the 

        portentousness of sentencing. Alternately (defensively?), I am thinking 

        that a sentence in a community of sentences (paragraphs) somehow leaving 

        impression of consciously reaching out to other(s). Notwithstanding characteristic 

        narrative flick of head back over shoulder. At point of the period. For 

        purpose of getting . . . bearings. This I finding . . . touching. A word 

        about the geography of the bar]:</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Many empty tables. 

        Two beefs in dark corner. Chairs fading outward. Towards sunwashed waitress, 

        purple shirt and harsh light of street. Waitress, flashlight and me. A 

        sign above our heads: "Les crevettes de MATANE arriv&eacute;es!!! <u>Fra&icirc;ches.</u> 

        MATANE shrimp in!!!! Fresh. The drawn-out Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois fra&icirc;&icirc;&icirc;ches 

        savorously feminine and plural. The waitress and purple shirt still complaining 

        Deneuve lacking edge. Offering as replacement, Qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise 

        country music star. Recently coming out with &quot;fabulous CD.&quot; 

        Though "star" still having to work nightly in bars. "Very tough. If you’re 

        pregnant." Outside, young nomad in artfully torn outfit and $50-dollar-haircut. 

        Asking for change in anglicized French. They come here from the suburbs. 

        Not to feel guilty. In this huge dark room with stuffed animals on walls, 

        I am thinking of simulation in a diminshing French-speaking city, where 

        everyone considering themselves minority; yet in some way also faking 

        it. I am thinking of consequence for narrative, so often straining toward 

        "natural" on site where continental popular culture in perpetual transmigration 

        from Germanic to Latinate. Of Mickey Mouse, Patsy Klein, Sylvester Stone, 

        moving lips in English. While saying something else entirely. I am thinking 

        of living on a Renaissance Ponte Vecchio: less bridge between than Babel 

        of echoes.** Whose interpretation requiring, precisely, resistance to 

        meaning. I am thinking of narration as introjection. Many friends have 

        dentures. A word about hybridity.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Two blocks up. Little 

        stages. Blue-and-white fleur-de-lys flags for the f&ecirc;te nationale. 

        The Argentinean tango I missed. Somehow having erased Qu&eacute;bec "patron" 

        Saint Jean Baptiste’s bleeding and miserable little lamb. Featured in 

        earlier decades’ national feast-day celebrations.* F&ecirc;te progressing 

        north. Group doing samba. Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois folk songs. Block production 

        of Moli&egrave;re farce. Free good food. Everyone speaking French &quot;with 

        accent.&quot; Whole family dragging mahogany dining table out on sidewalk. 

        Now eating supper. Later, I, sleepless, listening to thunderclaps on John 

        Cage piece. To compensate for dryness. Leopardskin waitress offering another 

        glass of vinegar. Muscled guy in tight sleeveless t-shirt and gleaming 

        chain with cross. I am thinking of narrative as opaque barrier. There 

        is no limit between life and deathly fascination. Viva Che! on wall. Now 

        I must go before another cigarette. Buy food. Take messages. If any. The 

        disease is not under control. Police car outside.</font></p>
