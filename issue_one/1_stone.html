    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I met 
      someone whose tattoo had been sliced out of his arm, leaving a jagged scar 
      in place of the name of city he was born. I understood the urge, to inject 
      a place under your skin, only to have it removed like a second stomach or 
      a wart. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about place. If you ask me where 
      I’m from, I can answer in a lot of different ways, none of which would tell 
      the whole story, or even manufacture the kind of sense I would want to live 
      with. I could show you the scar on my leg and point to an intersection, 
      or trace the scar angling up from the first phalange on my index finger, 
      pointing out the parking lot where the Streetsville liquor store used to 
      be. I could tell you about strip malls, or stock yards, or franchised donut 
      shops that remind me of Dresden the morning after, draw you a map of the 
      territory in the fine sprinkling of ash collecting on a Formica counter. 
      I could tell you about the derelict cornfields that used to be where that 
      donut shop is now, or the first place I lived in St.-Henri, show you the 
      abandoned granary that burned to the ground seven years ago and has since 
      been replaced by industrial trailers. Or maybe the building I lived in itself, 
      which is sealed off now. I might point out the remains of a much older structure, 
      a series of barn-board sheds. I would go to one of those sheds each afternoon 
      to write. The pick-up-sticks anatomy of that place inspired local kids into 
      acts of arson. I don’t know if it was my own narrative tendencies or the 
      steady supply of thirteen year olds with zippos, but it was the first part 
      of the building they chose to tear down. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I should 

      tell you, before we go any further, that the scar is really on my pointer 

      finger. You should know this story is not particularly reliable and, as 

      a friend told me once while I was staring absently at a menu, the map is 

      not the territory.</font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Somehow, 
      during the months I spent in that shed, writing what would become <b>jacks: 
      a gothic gospel</b>, the smell of the packing plant my father took me to 
      as a girl infiltrated the barn-boards. The plant was on his delivery route, 
      and I used to stop off at the stock yards to pet the shit-stained flanks 
      of cows as they were herded into slaughter. St-Henri reeks of my childhood 
      and the Streetsville liquor store is as organized as a month’s supply of 
      birth control pills, the bins of national and international wines formatted 
      on the principle of a 28-day dial, the kind that comes complete with seven 
      sugary pills to remind you of the color red. When I think of all the places 
      that have come to dereliction, I understand myself in terms of the word 
      tenacious. I know it is only my thinking that makes it so. I don’t know 
      if they hand out birth control pills to fourteen year olds anymore, the 
      kind that remind me of a flattened representation of a monthly agenda or 
      a rolodex with a daily regimen of business cards. I do know that the smell 
      of those stockyard cows do not belong in this essay. Nor does the way they 
      kill cows in the Eastern Townships, which is much more and much less personal. 
      </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I also 
      think its important to tell you, before I go any further, that I am not 
      a vegetarian. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On my 

      friend’s farm, the breeders have names like Sophia or, out of earshot, are 

      called after her daughters-in-law. The cows she will slaughter and wrap 

      herself are named after beige-toned bureaucratic dociers. When I first met 

      the woman who owns this farm, I asked about the cows and was given the names 

      of the breeders and the bull, the others implied by a slurred ellipsis or 

      existing as the space-off to her story. I persisted, asking about one of 

      the cows she’d passed over. &quot;T-2306? Or do you mean that one?&quot; 

      she asked, pointing to Sophia, &quot;they’re sisters.&quot; A little later 

      that day, she promised to save that cow’s thigh-bone for my dog. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 

      cows exist in terms of place. The cows of the stockyard and the cows of 

      the townships farm are the same breed, indistinguishable, except for their 

      deformation in terms of place. Even their smells are different. Sophia and 

      T-2306 are twin sisters, born on the same day, from the same uterus. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If I 

      were to write about T-2306, I would want something of that tension to come 

      through. The format of the place infiltrating something which might be appalled 

      identity. Or perhaps by identity I mean body-as-place. If I were a photographer, 

      I might take a long-exposure photograph, the kind that effaces her body 

      if it implies movement, if her body-as-place shifts in relation to geographical 

      setting. The immobile objects and landscape would exist in the picture as 

      perfect solids. It would be an unremarkable photo, except for the way you 

      could see right through the cow to everything behind it. Except for the 

      way the picture would be taken as daylight gave way to dark, and something 

      of that lumen would gather the hide together into the appearance of a bruise. 

      </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 

      length of exposure is an interesting way for me to begin to think about 

      length in narrative. As I am given to understand the technique, if you lengthen 

      the time that the shutter is open, the camera slowly tucks whatever light 

      there is into an object’s surfaces. I’ve seen night photos taken with a 

      long exposure, the light isn’t reflected off the surfaces of an object so 

      much as collected there, staining the fabric. The light appears to be a 

      dirty liquid, seething up from under. The implications fascinate me, the 

      way that pulling sight long can deform what is there, or ways of seeing 

      it. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Thankfully, 
      I am not bound to a single snapshot, because I want to examine (and re-examine), 
      lit (et relire), bed (and embed), these surfaces, under-pinning the impoverished 
      look of St-Henri, for instance, with the reek of a west-end Toronto slaughter 
      house, twenty years distant in time, and 600 kilometers away. I want the 
      space-off of the shed I started writing <b>jacks</b> in to be that terrifying 
      plant. God: What is that? What is it? The dingy white towers next to the 
      stockyards are organized vertically, even though, as everybody knows, cows 
      are organized horizontally&#151;they are grazers, right? So, between the 
      slaughterhouse and the packing plant some terrible deformation of what it 
      means to be a cow occurs, the axis of cowness undergoes a grotesque skew. 
      How do you even fit the word &quot;cow&quot; in a building that tall? What 
      could a building with elevators possibly have to do with a cow? When I was 
      a girl, I wasn’t afraid of the men with electrical prods, or the smell of 
      shit and death. But I was terrified by those vertical towers. I knew they 
      embodied a cold and impersonal force. If I called out to the men prodding 
      the cows, for instance, I could get them to talk to me, stop what they were 
      doing for a while. I doubted my presence could effect a pause when it came 
      to anything in or about those buildings. It wasn’t so much that I didn’t 
      exist, as it was that in their terms, I could not possibly exist. I lacked 
      the relevance to insist my own axis likewise undergo some miraculous Holstein 
      shift from x to y. The plant excluded all terms but those present in its 
      formula. If I had Go&euml;dal for a companion on those walks through the 
      slaughterhouse, they might have made another kind of sense. As it is, the 
      memory refuses my attempts at sense-making, and continues to fascinate me 
      twenty years later. The shed I came to narrative in has been torn down, 
      and the vertical granary -- the one that existed at the place where Beaudoin 
      stutters to a stop at rue St-Ambroise, the one that once implied the axial-shift 
      undergone by a field of wheat -- burned to the ground one winter night as 
      I watched. These places have a grammar that I am only now beginning to grapple 
      with (or make-up). </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I should 

      probably confess that I’ve apprehended a similar syntax in unfamiliar restaurants. 

      Once, a maitre-D unfolded my body like a table cloth, the surface tension 

      flattening and lengthening my body to the skin of water, it delineated a 

      lumen that precisely. Sensing some terrifying grammar, I found that the 

      only punctuation legible to me were the round bottoms of oven-warmed plates 

      pressing into my back like a series of medieval cups. The kind 17th century 

      doctors heat with candles before placing in rows on either side of the spine, 

      creating a series of tiny vacuums to draw the suspected impurity up from 

      under. I find restaurants inscrutable. I mean, who would think to spell 

      the word &quot;spent&quot; on a plate in a diagonal line of cutlery? But 

      god, the relief to discover there was a silent means to signal an impending 

      departure.</font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What 

      happens in the meantime? As your liminal-linen body hosts a series of plates? 

      And yes, physically, the body is a place that can, with some effort, be 

      occupied by one's self, or by others. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I am 

      not at a restaurant. If I close my eyes, I lose my boundaries, the air is 

      tepid against my skin, no rough frisson strokes this surface. I am not sensitive 

      enough to maintain a secure sense of where I end and something other begins. 

      That requires a leper’s perpetual gaze to the extremities. If I were to 

      close my eyes and begin typing by rote, you would have to remind me: Where 

      are my arms just now? my fingers...</font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I am 

      only sure of the tips. As they pad against the keys. One of my fingers describes 

      an unstable arch. I’ve pulled a tendon with this incessant tapping. It must 

      be a very tiny tendon, the kind of thing you might extract from the haunch 

      of a bisected frog. Eyes closed, I am the stoop of shoulders, the curve 

      of a sore finger, and a series of insensitive pads I’ve developed as a result 

      of my obsessive predilection for narrative -- long narrative. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This 
      is where I am today, and not at a restaurant packing plant. I am at the 
      place the scar on my index finger describes, an intersection between place 
      and the body. Writing narrative affords me a lateral way in which to think 
      about the body, about place, about the body in place, about the body as 
      place. In <b>Hush</b>, written very much like those long-exposures I talked 
      of earlier, the women exist in terms of place&#151;a narrative focus that, 
      on the surface, would deny movement. But writing against the vertical axis, 
      implying it, even as I choose to write on the horizontal plane, I can let 
      a particular image accrete to itself all sorts of other resonances&#151;not 
      just in the way a particular image occurs in relation to her-body, Rose’s 
      body, Loralie’s body, but how it recurs, in relation to other events or 
      objects or the place itself. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Plot 
      is a term that I hear twice, I hear the English plot and the fran&ccedil;ais 
      plotte, or cunt&#151;so it is a gendering of narrative. I am not about plot. 
      But am about this other form of plotting in narrative. Of telling a story 
      that unfolds at the level of language, where the words I use recur over 
      the length of the narrative. The repetition becomes skewed, and what it 
      touches, likewise becomes communicable. It isn’t mood, or even sensibility 
      I’m aiming at, though that’s what descriptive words are employed for a lot 
      of the time. No, what is here is as convoluted as the vaginal tract of a 
      snail, and though yes, snail’s plottes are bundled relatively small, they 
      do possess immense surfaces to play on. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I should 

      admit I’ve forgotten the word for a word that is descriptive. </font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Where 
      am I going next? I want you to imagine a picture taken with a very long 
      exposure. No. I want you to imagine you think of the phrase &quot;glory-hole&quot; 
      every time you hear the word exposure, and then I want you to imagine a 
      picture taken with a very long exposure. A picture taken on a night at the 
      circus. The temporal trace of the antics of acrobats and Dahlmer-clowns 
      rendered in fly-wheels of color. Are you sufficiently distracted? Good. 
      Because until a moment ago I was holding a Polaroid in my hand. It was a 
      very old picture, or else, someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make 
      it look that way. The edges are black from fingering. If I was going to 
      show you the picture, evidently, I changed my mind, because while you were 
      looking at the circus-shot, I slipped the picture into my pocket and lit 
      a cigarette.</font></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I think 

      you should know that I am familiar with the practical applications of luting 

      agents.</font></p>
