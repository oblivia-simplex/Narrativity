  <div class=Section1> 
    <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>The 
      water is blackish, green, and dark.<br>
      </span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>It 
      gathers from its separated state, gathers from rain, gathers into stream. 
      <br>
      It gathers in the mountain. <br>
      It gathers then travels, collects to become brackish. <br>
      Water travels, falls over a cliff, is falling. <br>
      Water is falling. <br>
      Falling onto rocks. <br>
      Because water falls it is. <br>
      Because water streams it is. <br>
      Because water collects into a pool it is narrative. <br>
      The pool is cold. <br>
      The pool is sheltered from sun by a cliff. <br>
      The pool is filled with rocks. <br>
      Water gathers over rocks, on rocks. <br>
      Moss gathers over rocks, on rocks. <br>
      Three arrive at this scene. <br>
      This scene where water is cold. <br>
      Where rocks are mossy. <br>
      When the three enter the pool their feet slip on rocks that are mossy. <br>
      As they slip, they slip deeper into water. <br>
      Slip on mossy coldness. <br>
      Slip into water so cold it makes their chest close. <br>
      Slip deeply in. <br>
      Water gathers them, gathers them by their slipping. <br>
      Water covers them. <br>
      Because water is brackish it is narrative. <br>
      Because water is brackish they don't open their mouths. <br>
      Because water is brackish they are closed in their immersion. <br>
      They do immerse. <br>
      But they don't open as they swim to falling water. <br>
      They stand beneath falling water. <br>
      Water beats down on them. <br>
      Beats on their shoulders. <br>
      Beats on their heads. Beats on them. <br>
      They stand beneath water that is a roar of a falling. <br>
      They stand in roar, in narrative. <br>
      But water is brackish. <br>
      So they do not kiss. <br>
      Do not open their mouth beneath the waterfall. <br>
      They let brackish water fall over them. <br>
      Over their heads. <br>
      Over their lips. <br>
      Over their eyes. <br>
      Over their ears. <br>
      Over their hands which they hold up to feel the roar landing into their 
      palms. <br>
      Down their body. <br>
      Brackish water. <br>
      Closed bodies. <br>
      Water gathers them to this place, this narrative place. <br>
      Water covers them and they are covered with brackish water. <br>
      They do immerse. <br>
      They don't open. <br>
      Immersion seals them off. <br>
      There is no open mouth. <br>
      No opening. <br>
      No exchanging. <br>
      Because it is brackish it is narrative falling over them.<br>
      It falls over. <br>
      It falls over them. <br>
      Sealed yet together. <br>
      They have come together with brackish. <br>
      They have let brackish wash over then even if they don't let it inside. 
      <br>
      Because water falls it is narrative. <br>
      Because they are immersed it is narrative. <br>
      Because they love each other while separated it is narrative. <br>
      Because the rocks are slippery with green moss it is narrative. <br>
      Because they slip on the rocks it is narrative. <br>
      Because they slip deeper into water. <br>
      Because they allow the slip, are prepared for the slip and love its immersion 
      it is narrative. Because it involves love it is narrative. <br>
      Because it leaves them alone it is narrative. </span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
