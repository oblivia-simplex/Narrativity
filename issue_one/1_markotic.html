  <p>.</p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I am interested in a dialogue 

    about &quot;new&quot; narrative, which is perhaps not so much <i>new</i>, 

    as newly theorized. Many prose writers do not consider themselves fiction 

    writers, yet at the same time are not really part of on-going poetics discussions 

    which, for the most part, do not focus on narrative. Although I also write 

    prose fiction, I consider my prose poetry and other alternative, interdisciplinary, 

    and innovative sentences to be a neoteric prose that both challenges and expands 

    language boundaries.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For me, the prose poem 

    is a poetic strategy embedded within the structure of narrative, and a feminist 

    response to patriarchal language and forms. By embracing both prose syntax 

    and poetic disruptions, the prose poem defies conventional linear grammar 

    and refuses to satisfy my desires for either poetry or story. My desire is 

    for so much more than causal, linear, rational and persuasive normative sentences. 

    In my novel and in my poetry, I try to live between the promise of narrative 

    and the fulfillment of the habit of fiction.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">By expropriating two distinct 
    genres while presenting a form of writing that is seen to consist of both, 
    prose poetry presents itself as hybrid writing; a hybrid that I explore as 
    crossing between the desire to exceed formal considerations, and the narrational 
    insistence surrounding such considerations. In my prose poems, I try to embrace 
    the problematic of poetry that &quot;looks&quot; like ordinary prose narrative, 
    yet invites disjunctive readings which may extend beyond traditional poetic 
    forms and conventional conceptions of narrative. My pieces &quot;fail&quot; 
    as poetry&#150;yet continually celebrate the erotic contradiction such failure 
    narrates.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The prose poem, for me, 
    offers itself as a &quot;genre&quot; that permits and encourages me to move 
    freely from sentence to line-break to full-stop to repetition. Without entirely 
    settling on its own definition, the prose poem rattles my airtight nerves, 
    upsets my crabapple go karts, insistently and lasciviously rubs my discourse 
    the wrong way&#151;inventing, always reinventing itself. Its very possibility 
    denies its own existence. For me, the prose poem remains liminal: not merely 
    transgressive, but indeterminite, caught in the phoenix act of disappearing, 
    reappearing as its own <i>possibility</i>.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">My interest in this form 
    begins at the level of the sentence. What makes a sentence a line of poetry 
    rather than an excerpt from an essay or novel? The answer, for me, is the 
    surrounding words and sentences, the position of those words on the page, 
    the complicated ache of the forced return at the end of each &quot;line.&quot; 
    Ear and eye games, the playing of interruption and proceed. Not stop-and-go, 
    but go-and-go-farther. As soon as I take a step towards the horizon, the horizon 
    reconfigures&#151;itself and me.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What interests me about 
    the sentence as poetic form is that poets who are <i>least</i> interested 
    in representational language are most often the ones who turn to a grammatical 
    structure which invests heavily in sentential logic. The use and abuse of 
    the sentence, then, seems to be the focus of the poem. And because one sentence 
    follows the next&#150;which offers a visual hypotasis but a semiotic parataxis&#151;the 
    poem insists on a reading that is far more linear (for lack of a better word), 
    than is a line-break poem with disparate images stacked one above the other. 
    The one poetic device designated as prose or <i>not</i> poetry, the sentence, 
    becomes the choice unit of composition for poets who intrigue me, shock me, 
    paratactically get under my skin. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Within each sentential 

    piece can emerge a plasticity resistant to notions of purity in either prose 

    <i>or</i> poetry. Gertrude Stein chose the sentence as her basic unit of composition. 

    Her sentences release readers from the semantic baggage traditionally loaded 

    into narrative prose as they re-define, distort, conflate, skew, and otherwise 

    render the sentence pliable and visceral:</font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;A kind in glass 
      and a cousin, a spectacle<br>
      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">and nothing strange 
      in a single hurt color and an</font><br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">arrangement in a system 
      to pointing. All this and</font><br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">not ordinary, not unordered 
      in not resembling. The<br>
      difference is spreading. (<b>Tender Buttons</b> 9)</font></p>

    </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Such prose rumbles inside 

    the belly of poetry, or perhaps poetry shifts awkwardly within the abdomen 

    of prose. Readers, seduced by sentence structure, discover themselves trespassing 

    an erotics of prose, transgressing away from familiar and known fiction offerings.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Writers engaging in what 

    Stephen Fredman calls &quot;poet’s prose,&quot; struggle to create new ideas 

    from <i>inside</i> the conventions that constitute the either/or structure 

    of the prose poem. This structure is the chance for prose writers to both 

    follow narrative and to deviate away from story. For example, Robert Kroetsch, 

    in his poem &quot;The Sad Phoenician,&quot; pursues an elusive and/but dialogue 

    that generates a bifurcated and pending narrative:</font></p>

  <blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Readers wander through 
    an and/but tug-of-war that is also a narrative wandering, from the Phoenicians 
    and Greeks to Saskatchewan, to the very grammar of the telling. It is this 
    <i>telling</i> that gets so many new prose writers into trouble&#151;isn’t 
    plot the very basis of novels? How can one tell a story and avoid fiction? 
    And why do we want to?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Feminist writers must 
    resist and reinvent patriarchal language to make it our own. We cross a border 
    every time we pick up a pen or turn on the computer or hum into a tape deck. 
    The border is a visible line on the page that the prose poem physically outlines. 
    For many women, this is not simply a gendered border, but one that has been 
    criss-crossed by social lines such as race or class. Harryette Mullen, in 
    her prose poetry book,<i> </i><b>S*PeRM**K*T</b>, investigates the connective 
    links between the social and the linguistic:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Mullen's disconnected 
    sentences can be read to produce meanings that address subjects ranging from 
    drugs to poverty in contemporary USA. But the structure of the &quot;narrative&quot; 
    does not create fictional characters and circumstances to battle these issues; 
    rather, Mullen's words entice at the same time as they startle reading practices. 
    Word association and colloquial speech patterns reinvent the chance to re-enter 
    the text from another crack. This text does not close the book on the story, 
    it continues to remind that reading is a socially-coded act, and that a reader's 
    subjectivity is constructed through how she enters language.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Language enters me, and 

    my sentences struggle against what I know to be &quot;just&quot; a sentence. 

    I hesitate in doorways and on fences, I plan my route along edges and cracks 

    in the sidewalk, I pencil in margins made up of words only words, and then 

    I cross over into blank space. Not because it is &quot;new&quot; or &quot;white&quot; 

    or &quot;virginal&quot; or any other dominant appropriative term, but because 

    the blank space is where the prose poem offers a <i>visible</i> margin, a 

    territory (known or not) that hangs onto the edges of writing, clings to the 

    edges of edges. I get edgy when I try to read or write a prose poem, anxious, 

    excitable, downright perplexed. I hang about on the inside of this perplexing 

    form because it keeps me on my language toes: unsure and insecure, tip-toeing 

    across whatever lines a poem insists upon.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I &quot;plot&quot; at 
    sentences and subterfuge, dream of a poetry that withstands ragged-right fashions, 
    yet continues to address narrative within disjunctive non-lineated prose. 
    I look to the prose poem as mutation&#150; by definition unstable, punctuated 
    by eternally reproducing desires.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I want to carry words 
    to where they’re already going, but not necessarily to where I think they're 
    carrying me. I strive to enact an and/but <i>narrative erotic</i> that is 
    neither fiction nor poetry, that invites readers to see beyond seeing and 
    write beyond reading. I veer away from the end of that prose line, from the 
    punct signifying the closing ceremony, the final page next to the cover, the 
    certain and the certified. I question the metaphorical imperative that insists 
    toes are what we tip on, and grasp instead the reassurance of instability, 
    embrace the inability to embrace a stable subjectivity, and echo cheerfully 
    what Kathleen Fraser describes as &quot;fragments of a wholeness only guessed 
    at&quot; (<b>Each Next</b>). My prose poems want/desire/lust after such guessing 
    contortions.</font></p>
