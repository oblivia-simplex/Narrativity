  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> One of the forms of narrative 

    I write is software. It’s lucrative. About four years ago I used stock options 

    to buy a house right around the corner plus one block from one of the worst 

    housing projects in San Francisco. A couple thousand people live there. It 

    gives my neighborhood the highest child hunger rate in the city. Our first 

    night in the house someone got murdered, just before midnight . It was a block 

    a way but the shot sounded like it was in our back yard. One shot, a pause, 

    then another. Purposeful. Somehow I knew it was intended to kill, and not 

    just a couple of kids shooting at the moon. Plus the neighbor told us he’d 

    had his car stolen 3 times. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Impenetrable poverty plus 

    dumb fuck rules, class and race segregation: I’d moved into the only San Francisco 

    neighborhood that duplicated on a smaller scale what I grew up with. It annoyed 

    me. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Locality, forever. <i>Skewed</i>. 
    Something huge gets mutilated as it slides through a stuffy tube. We’re on 
    the beach very far to the west, watching what pops out. It contains all of 
    American culture. I came here so tightly wound. Born on 43rd street south 
    side Chicago &amp; haven’t been back since I left the hospital. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">From my dining room window, 

    at the rear of the house, the project looks strangely vacant. There just never 

    seem to be many people around. The buildings proceed down the hill towards 

    the old industrial port like giant shabby steps, but there is never anyone 

    on the racks of balconies. I’ve rarely driven through it. Structurally, it’s 

    sort of a dead-end place, the way it’s laid out, like a suburban subdivision: 

    streets point into it, then twist up like spaghetti. The few drive-through 

    streets are dotted with dealers scoping out the passing cars. I’m just talking 

    about the roads. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">When I first moved in 
    I often found myself dreamily staring out the dining room window. I wanted 
    to check out one of those balconies. The view would be amazing, they practically 
    hang over the bay. Developers have been salivating over that piece of land 
    for years. Nowadaze they are nibbling at the edges of the project, building 
    expensive live work lofts for software designers on adjoining vacant industrial 
    land. It’s weird. Different economic classes get spliced together via crimes. 
    The mode of interaction being criminal. So one day I mentioned to a friend 
    of mine that I didn’t get it, how did dealers get kids to work for them&#151;playing 
    courier, or delivery boy. What would a dealer have on a kid? Why get involved 
    with some jacked-up, scary asshole? I felt like an idiot as soon as the words 
    left my mouth. Patiently, step by step, my friend explained how it was done, 
    until I could have done it myself, as obviously he had. All I had to do was 
    ask. Knowledge. The getting &amp; taking and the tearing up. Did I want to 
    go there? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Of course I did. One day 

    I walked in, took a place on the balcony next to all of my friends &amp; drank 

    their salty water. I listened to the radio. I watched as a crack lady ran 

    down the street behind a white dog. Then the dog was scratching at the door. 

    When I woke up that sound was the shade, bumping against the window frame. 

    And I was thinking, as I am always doing and my thinking told me this: <i>This 

    is what I want. It’s inside my system of attractions. I’m penetrated by the 

    present and it’s always the same: chronic anger. Awful but refreshing</i>. 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">From up here, it is all 

    visible. From down below, also. Radiant contradiction. Eyeballs: the severely 

    vivid mechanism. Finally what is seen is not a target but just circumference, 

    expanding. Highlights scatter across the field. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I walked into the projects 
    a couple of weeks ago. It’s right around the corner, why not just walk? It 
    was a friend’s birthday. She told me where she lived, but it wasn’t easy to 
    find. The apartments didn’t have numbers on them, you had to just know. I 
    asked a bunch of people. Kids were running everywhere. How come I hadn’t seen 
    them from my back window? I look whiter than usual, I thought, looking at 
    my hand. Up here and not even shopping, that made me odd. People looked at 
    me skeptically. I felt skeptical about myself, but slick, as in greased. I 
    wanted to fall off my little ledge. Bored with what had gotten dished up as 
    myself. The backwash of swallowing it. That nausea. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The balcony was great. 

    I hung with my friends and listened to the radio. They played that song I 

    like, the one about money. Later we went out to eat birthday steaks. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">California is shallow. 

    That’s true. Though it thrills me that I can walk across the city without 

    getting beat up for crossing some invisible dividing line of racial turf. 

    Of course I could get beat up for something else. <i>I’m so easy to please.</i> 

    It’s the instability at the heart which is to say the heartlessness of just 

    washing away faster. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I’m supposed to write 

    about narrativity but these problems of locality are where I get started. 

    For me writing grinds itself into what’s familiar yet unbearable. Add mobility 

    to that and, voila, narrative. Disjunction is the formal consequence of this 

    ripping and tearing, and it’s packed with information, almost to the point 

    of being insensible. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The streets I walk measure 

    me. They measure you too, through mechanisms both criminal and friendly. Including 

    that knowledge is a kind of spectacular innocence---the moment of saturation 

    feels dazzling, but there is probably no point. Still I love it, formally 

    and erotically and intimately. It’s all about nested structures. I entrust 

    my twisted little pieces to the warm nest of the sick social body, and I feel 

    our bond. It nourishes me. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To theorize my point of 

    view, to pursue critical formalism as a ritual and as a grasp for power, let 

    me put it this way. Narrative provides context so that the rupturing of identity 

    is recognizable. I think we are impossible beings. We ruthlessly evade scrutiny, 

    yet recognition is the beginning of transformative emotion. It’s a feeding 

    process. You don’t know if you’re creating a monster. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As a narrative writer 

    I improvise recognition. It’s like a location from which mutant beings emerge. 

    This feels true, in life they never stop emerging. Look---they even swarm 

    through this text. I allow it because I’m terrified and seduced. To encounter 

    them via narrative is to formalize a moment of surrender.</font></p>
