| Once upon a time, there was a man named Birdy, older then than now,   |
| whose job was to remind a text on memory of where it had been and why |
| it had missed itself there, as if he were a third-person argument     |
| between a first and a second person who tried to keep appointments,   |
| but whose lives, in the event, were compromised by one emergency      |
| after another, so that one or the other always got stuck waiting,     |
| picking up the check, taking the wrong bus home.                      |
|                                                                       |
| \"Otherwise,\" he said, coming to his senses already in an anaphoric  |
| mood on the curled linoleum floor, decorated in a grease-beclouded    |
| floral pattern, of a dimly familiar kitchenette, talking to no one in |
| particular, or else an offstage presence stuck in an abandoned        |
| episode, \"you\'d simply live the singer-songwriter myth, and have    |
| nothing to say for yourself but a lot of florid weeping and moaning.  |
| I knocked a little hole in your wall because I care. Pornography      |
| drives the photograph forward into full relation to its time, and     |
| becomes a method to produce clear prospects on what was once obscure. |
| I continue to love your body, the taste of your tongue and sweaty     |
| ass, only because I simply can\'t imagine you, and see not you, but a |
| broad expanse of sky, on the far side of every window into which I    |
| peep.\"                                                               |
