# Sleep is the Only Durable Narrative

Elizabeth Robinson


Â 


| A person is falling asleep.
| There is some delay while the body shifts. Breathing
| slows. He is
| apparently asleep.
| But then he moves again.
| Legs above the blanket, legs below the blanket.
| The changes in rhythm are interminable. But this
| is the story.
|
| Sleeping itself. When he is
| finally asleep, the body can resume
| remaking itself or
| call on a project of outright fabrication. He doesn\'t
| know his own story, except as he respires it.
| Cells re-coat. Dreams are irrelevant. Connective
| tissue lengthens, glossing itself.
|
| He is a wonderful entity, finally
| voiceless and productive. Except were he
| to fall apart in his sleep, a possibility
| that has its own unity.
|
| This is mostly a string of overlapping
| events gone unwitnessed. Unless someone
| who cannot go to sleep is lying there too.
| She goes through similar shifts and
| sighs. What validity does
| his sleep gain
|
| by virtue of her not sleeping--- She decides to notice
| his repose; she decides not to.
| She considers that she is eavesdropping
| somnolence, but it\'s not so
|
| in a tale that cannot be permeated. Corpuscles
| mending themselves. Insomniac,
| she confesses that she is eavesdropping
| her own unmaking, awake. This is not
| an anti-story, but an alternative.
|
| White lights come in through the window,
| begging a source. Now the frazzled body
| rears up, claims that light as more than immanent, dying
| to spy, at least, on some body. However atomic
| or abrupt.
