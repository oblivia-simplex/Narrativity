| **Notes on Narrativity - Writing in Prose
| **
|
| *Prior to my life as a writer, I was a student of anthropology. I
| still do not know exactly what this means, other than it is printed
| on my college diploma. I do know that I am obsessed with what makes
| us human and how this human configuration struggles to differentiate
| itself from animal. This study of human is of course a study of self
| and other, a study of self in family, a study of family as self.
| However is about family, about the process of aging and the
| injustices this culture (as if a singular referent could actually
| take on so much meaning) inflicts on the old. However is an
| ethnography of the last few weeks of my grandmother\'s life and her
| shouting right back at me - you got it wrong and right, a little
| right. However is in prose because this process of description is too
| messy for a pretty mobile of string and glass. However is in prose
| because prose is the viscous tissue of body and there is a lot of
| body, its excrement, in this piece. However is in prose because, as
| James Clifford wrote in the Predicament of Culture, \"participant
| observation obliges its practitioners to experience, at a bodily as
| well as intellectual level, the vicissitudes of translation.\"
| However is in prose because there is too much, rather than too
| little, to say.*

| Not accounting for everything---who could---not just the alcohol and
| the iron deficiency, but other failures as well. What happened
| exactly. The itchy warmth of the car seat. The light from the house
| across the way. My own need to itch and scratch and be done with it.
| Of course this body no longer responds, I am earlier and inside taut
| skin, two breasts. Even the car is not liquid of the body which fed
| them, taught them how to walk into a nursing home and sign me up for
| a cruise around the parking lot, my feet above the wheels of the
| chair. As if a wheelchair could contain all that is inside of me.
| Such structures remember nothing and I remember everything that
| transpired. It is not the recollecting but how to frame it in what
| they know.
| I know they know nothing.
|
| Real-estate is not a sure thing, I told them after the fires, but
| they forgot. So now almost paralyzed and past speech I can only watch
| them arrange things, moving the couch, replacing the tattered cloth.
| Home is after all only a settling of dust. I cannot move, so dust
| settles. Settling. They put me near the picture, underneath it, an
| awkward likeness. Pointy nose, unfriendly hair. My hair, like many
| things, is no longer mine. A purple haze about my head. How they
| frame me.
|
| The towel is rough and the shower too hot. Each time it is a
| different nurse. Mrs. Gagnon, they scold when my legs buckle or a
| rebellious ankle twists. They set me on the toilet to rest, each of
| us exhausted by the eighty-three pounds of yield. The bathroom so
| unlike my own and still I get lost between them. The girls think the
| water angry and the grass along the yard just weeds. Everything was
| planted with his own hands, large scaly trout even though he was
| chicken legs and a crows fat beak. Mom, they say and try to bend my
| elbow outside its range. They are making up, or evening out. Those
| years I yelled and complained and wished them unhappy marriages and
| thankless children. No need to wish such things, every one of them
| cries themselves to sleep. Perhaps only now. Or after.
|
| Clutching the pillow, my name across the breast. They know me as my
| order in their birth, first generation, narrow fingers scaring an
| uneven yellow embroidery, grandma it would say if it were legible,
| granbra or jomda. The girls hold my arms, leather handles on the
| suitcases they carry, satisfied with my containment. A body folded
| into an origami crane and stuffed into the front seat of a car, my
| car, now theirs. See mom, just a few blocks, not that different. They
| think my silence not thought or post-thought as if counting was
| beyond a brain once stroked. Each distance the length of my tongue
| and I know they are lying, driving me outside my own frequency so
| even the hairdresser will be lost and cannot mix the exact shade of
| dusk that is my hair.
| What injury can touch these few blocks, my home since before he died
| and I roamed them like a doll house, my hooked body fitting perfectly
| through each door.

| Whose life so easily told as words. They think I am past me or they
| hold me in their earliest versions so I am no longer part of
| description, an obstacle even to the sight of family. Perhaps I am
| these trees along the freeway dusty with carbon monoxide or the
| eucalyptus behind the nursing home shedding. The body takes much
| longer to break free of limbs, forgetting my other daughter\'s name
