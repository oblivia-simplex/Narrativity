# Quotes from the Editors



In guise of an "editorial," we gave ourselves the task of contributing quotes that seemed exemplary or important to us as writers at this time. Informed by science (Burke's notion of coarse-graining, implying the production of prose as pattern), by references Biblical, Benjaminian, post structuralist, post-Marxist, Oulipo-ian, etc., these cut-outs, compounded, comprise our narrative about Narrativity. For now. Signed Mary. Camille. Bob. Gail.
 

## Quotes from Bob Glück


### From *Antonin Artaud Anthology*, ed. Jack Hirschman

From this pain rooted in me like a wedge, at the center of my purest
reality, at the point of my sensibility where the two worlds of body
and mind are joined, I have learned to distract myself by the effect
of a false suggestion.

For in the space of that minute the illumination of a lie can last, I
manufacture a notion of escape; I rush off in any wrong direction my
blood takes. I close the eyes of my intelligence and open my mouth to
the speech of the unspoken; I give myself the illusion of a system
whose vocabulary escapes me. But from this minute of error there
remains the feeling that I have snatched something real from the
unknown. I believe in spontaneous bewitchments. It is impossible that
I shall not some day discover a truth somewhere on the routes my
blood carries me.


### From *The Gospel According to Thomas*

Jesus saw some little ones nursing. He said to his disciples, What
these little ones who are nursing resemble is those who enter the
kingdom. They said to him, So shall we enter the kingdom by being
little ones? Jesus said to them, When you make the two one and make
the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside and the
above like the below, and that you might make the male and the female
be one and the same, so that the male might not be male nor the
female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye and a hand in
the place of a hand and a foot in place of a foot, an image in place
of an image then you will enter the kingdom.


### From *Foucault/Blanchot, Maurice Blanchot*: "The Thought from the Outside\" by Michel Foucault


If the only site for language is indeed the solitary sovereignty of
"I speak\" then in principle nothing can limit it---not the one to
whom it is addressed, not the truth of what it says, not the values
or systems of representation it utilizes. In short, it is no longer
discourse and the communication of meaning, but a spreading forth of
language in its raw state, an unfolding of pure exteriority. And the
subject that speaks is less the responsible agent of a discourse
(what holds it, what uses it to assert and judge, what sometimes
represents itself by means of a grammatical form designed to have
that effect) than a non-existence in whose emptiness the unending
outpouring of language uninterruptedly continues.



### From **The Madness of the Day**, by Maurice Blanchot, trans. Lydia Davis

I am not learned; I am not ignorant. I have known joys. That is
saying too little: I am alive, and this life gives me the greatest
pleasure. And what about death? When I die (perhaps any minute now),
I will feel immense pleasure. I am not talking about the foretaste of
death, which is stale and often disagreeable. Suffering dulls the
senses. But this is the remarkable truth, and I am sure of it: I
experience boundless pleasure in living, and I will take boundless
satisfaction in dying.


I have wandered: I have gone from place to place. I have stayed in
one place, lived in a single room. I have been poor, then richer,
then poorer than many people. As a child I had great passions, and
everything I wanted was given to me. My childhood has disappeared, my
youth his behind me. It doesn't matter. I am happy about what has
been. I am pleased by what is, and what is to come suits me well
enough.


Is my life better than other peoples lives? Perhaps. I have a roof
over my head and many do not. I do not have leprosy, I am not blind,
I see the world---what extraordinary happiness! I see this day, and
outside it there is nothing. Who could take that away from me? And
when this day fades, I will fade along with it---a thought, a
certainty, that enraptures me.


I have loved people. I have lost them. I went mad when that blow
struck me, because it is hell. But there was no witness to my
madness, my frenzy was not evident: only my innermost being was mad.
Sometimes I became enraged. People would say to me, Why are you so
calm? But I was scorched from head to foot; at night I would run
through the streets and howl; during the day I would work calmly.


### From "Crossing into Poland\" by Isaac Babel trans. Walter Morison, **The Collected Stories**.

Fields flowered around us, crimson with poppies; a noontide breeze
played in the yellowing rye; on the horizon virginal buckwheat rose
like the wall of a distant monastery. The Volyns peaceful stream
moved away from us in sinuous curves and I was lost in the pearly
haze of the birch groves; crawling between flowery slopes, it wound
weary arms through a wilderness of hops. The orange sun rolled down
the sky like a lopped-off head, and mild light glowed from the cloud
gorges. The standards of the sunset flew above our heads. Into the
cool of evening dripped the smell of yesterdays blood, of slaughtered
horses. The blackened Zbruch roared, twisting itself into foamy knots
at the falls. The bridges were down, and we waded across the river.
On the waves rested a majestic moon. The horses were into the
cruppers, and the noisy torrent gurgled among hundreds of horses
legs. Somebody sank, loudly defaming the Mother of God. The river was
dotted with the square black patches of the wagons, and was full of
confused sounds, of whistling and singing, that rose above the
gleaming hollows, the serpentine trails of the moon.

## Quotes from Camille Roy

### Excerpts from "The Storyteller,\" by Walter Benjamin

The art of storytelling is coming to an end. Less and less frequently
do we encounter people with the ability to tell a tale properly. More
and more often there is embarrassment all around when the wish to
hear a story is expressed. It is as if something that seemed
inalienable to us, the securest among our possessions, were taken
from us: the ability to exchange experiences.[^2_AAA_Editorial_cr1]

One reason for this phenomenon is obvious: experience has fallen in
value... \[The nature of every real story is that\] it contains,
openly or covertly, something useful. The usefulness may, in one
case, consist in a moral; in another, in some practical advice, in a
third, in a proverb or maxim. In every case the storyteller is a man
who has counsel for his readers. But if today "having counsel\" is
beginning to have an old-fashioned ring, this is because the
communicability of experience is decreasing. In consequence we have
no counsel either for ourselves or for others.

Every morning brings us the news of the globe, and yet we are poor in
noteworthy stories. This is because no event any longer comes to us
without already being shot through with explanation. In other words,
by now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost
everything benefits information. Actually, it is half the art of
storytelling to keep a story from explanation as one reproduces it.

The value of information does not survive the moment in which it was
new. It lives only at that moment; it has to surrender to it
completely and explain itself to it without losing any time. A story
is different. It does not expend itself. It preserves and
concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing it even after a
long time.

*Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.*
Today people live in rooms that have never been touched by death, dry
dwellers of eternity, and when their end approaches they are stowed
away in sanatoria or hospitals by their heirs. It is, however,
characteristic that not only a man's knowledge or wisdom, but above
all his real life---and this is the stuff that stories are made
of---first assumes transmissible form at the moment of his death.
Just as a sequence of images is set in motion inside a man as his
life comes to an end---unfolding the views of himself under which he
has encountered himself without being aware of it---suddenly in his
expressions and looks the unforgettable emerges and imparts to
everything that concerned him that authority which even the poorest
wretch in dying possesses for the living around him. This authority
is at the very source of the story.

Death is the sanction of everything that the storyteller can tell. He
has borrowed his authority from death.


[\[I love this essay, although it doesn\'t address what seems to me
to be a distortion in the general view of the narrative process:
story**telling**. In addition to the story which is told, there is
the story withheld. Attraction, narrative suspense, emanates from the
latter. The story withheld has its own (buried) structure and
tension. The reader marries the hidden story, not the visible one.
That is why we continue to read a story that inspires dread. An
attachment has been formed---surreptitiously. It operates like a
craving, which is how I recognize Benjamin's reference to death. The
craving for the unknown, as it is held by the act of storytelling,
points to death (or its substitute, the body). (Roy)]\]


## Excerpts from "Fame,\" by Robert Gluck

There are contradictory reasons when I use "real\" people in my
work, and the contradictions comfort me. Any literary practice
should, I think, derive from contradictory sources and motives... I
name names to evoke the already-known, to make writing co-extend with
the world and history, and to examine the fiction of personality, as
well as the fiction of the word.... I propose self-community-story
as a tonic for the loss of human scale; by naming
self-community-story I participate in their disintegration, their
progress from invisibility to something to be named and
manipulated---to be reintegrated later in a new context, in a third
term that history must provide.[^2_AAA_Editorial_cr2]

Prolonged scrutiny can become an expenditure of self, a potlatch of
self. I've come to experience the unreeling of interiority and
sexual disclosure as such a loss, and also part of a historical
trajectory. It's a writing activity that privileges the aggression
of naming---an ongoing colonization of self into one's own language.
Once something is named, you are in relation to it. Name the disease
to cure it.

We want to see a story as we see other representations: being hiding
behind appearance---that is, hiding and revealing the body. But the
use of real names [in my work\] reorders connections and
disjunctions. I do mean fragmentation. I don't want to make the
predictable distinction between story and fragmented writing. Naming
names creates an open form that co-extends with the world. In a
postmodern switch, it applies the open form of modernism to content
by putting quote marks around the entire story, turning the story
into a fragment, an example of a story. The story floats---as gossip
does---between the lives of the people who are its characters, and
the lives of its readers (in that thorny field of reader/writer
dynamics). The problem of figure and ground becomes a social one, and
some of what is existential in the content is subtracted and
reintegrated in the relation between reader and writer.

... Using real names provides a relation between the writer and
myself that carries some risk, like performance art. What I witness
is always the same: any story hides and then reveals the body.


[\[Two aspects of narrative writing have been subjected to
devastating critiques: the linearity of narrative, and the
credibility of the narrator. (The popularity of the memoir is in part
due to the diminished credibility of anything other than an
autobiographical voice.) The critical and political forces which
produced these critiques have pushed experimental narrative writers
to the boundary where form collapses into experience. The searching
re-examination of narrative premises becomes part of the practice.
(Roy)]\]


## Excerpts from "Paragraphs Blowing On A Line,\" by Gail Scott

### Entry 11:

She sees the present as a great tear, a great rip in the surface of
things: the gap of which is at first impossible for her to move
across (*...does not thinking seek forever to clamp a dressing over
the gaping and violent wound of the impossibility of
thought...[^2_AAA_Editorial_cr4] It is awareness of this that
makes linear narrative impossible. A virtually tragic awareness, for
the writing "I,\" which modernists began to \"deconstruct\" as they
recognized that gap (accepted to give up power) has, in her case,
been "deconstructed\" a priori by social conditions. She is not only
split between the self and the "real\", but also within the
self...[^2_AAA_Editorial_cr3]

So the question becomes how to write across the almost ...
hysterical ... overdetermination of her gaps\...

Maybe my resistance to the narrative conventions of the novel have to
do with what I think of as its Protestant qualities: its earnest
representation of the "real,\" its greed for action, its preference
for the concrete over the philosophical.

A compromise might be possible: structuring the story by means of the
fluctuations in her ... (dare I?) hysterical voice. The use of the
voice invoking a poetic meaning in excess of the sentence....

Blows: violent and unusual interruptions in her narrative
texture-which texture the writing is hopefully starting to discover.
More and more I intuit that it has to do with starting from a
negative point: a crushed ego that doesn't see its boundaries.

### Entry 25

During this whole process I have been caught between the need to
accomplish this thing, which is both to posit some new kind of
subject and to have the sense of being a subject myself; and yet to
resist repeating, by creating a "feminist narrative,\" what Barthes
calls ... the staging of a new \"father,\" a new hierarchy of
acceptable concepts. (*Every narrative (every unveiling of the truth)
is a staging of the ... father.*) Maybe what my heroine discovers in
trying to write her novel is only that the novel doesn't suit the
(diffuse?) women's way of seeing things. Where there is closure
(firm conclusions) in "straight writing\" there are spaces,
questions in hers. Even her anecdotes point to other possible
representations, leave themselves open for reader intervention.

Still, given that my firm and conscious intention has been to counter
(patriarchal) ideology in this process, the poststructuralist recipe
for taking apart everything from the sentence to the author won't
entirely do. Presumably I have to at least propose some other
direction: language slips all around us. One's response to that is a
question of the relationship between writing (what it comprises of
consciousness) and body. Again to quote Barthes: *The text needs its
shadow. This shadow is a* bit *of ideology, a* bit *of
representation, a* bit *of subject: ghosts, pockets, traces,
necessary clouds. Subversion must produce its own chiaroscuro.*

[\[It is generally true that reviews of experimental narrative do
not have a critical vocabulary for what the writer is doing. The goal
seems to be attaching a label to the content without "giving it
away". Narrative practice, as a field of critical inquiry, is in a
practically fetal state. Theory borrowed from poetics is not adequate
for describing or investigating how narratives work, what is at stake
in narrative, the social field narratives both operate within and set
up. The interventions into the social field which experimental
narratives perform are usually in practice imperceptible,
indistinguishable from background noise, unless the critical piece is
written by the writer herself. If narrative writers want the deepest
issues in their work to be visible, they must supply the critical
ideas that drive their practice. This journal will hopefully be a
place that supports the development of that discussion. (Roy)]\]


## Excerpts from "Interview with Carla Harryman,\" by Chris Tysh

Tysh: "The I expands,\" you wrote in \"Realism.\" In this age of
decentered subjectivities, how do you deploy the narrative machinery
of the "I\" and the various sensibilities it is associated with?
Could you discuss the techniques with which you defamiliarize your
use of the first-person pronoun and in general address the issue of
the speaking subject in your prose. Who speaks?[^2_AAA_Editorial_cr5]

Harryman: My answer to this question is complex and leads to
difficulties because I associate the I with power, control,
destruction, gender, and whatever might transpire or exhibit itself
between the poles of animation and passivity. Mine is an unwieldy set
of interests, less easy to organize into the kinds of discussion that
the problems of "confession\" or \"authenticity\" lend themselves
to; even so, as you will see, I am concerned with the relation of the
"self\" to the limits of knowledge.

When I think about the I, what first comes to mind is omniscience in
novels. (My understanding of literary device and the problem of
authorship comes as much from reading novels as poetry. ) I will use
Balzac as an example, because he has come up in my writing from time
to time. Balzac wanted to account for all the history of France as it
related to the ruptures of the bourgeois revolution. The expanding I
here would be Balzac-as-author-of-France, i.e., Balzac as authorial
agent/persona, rather than a deployment within the narrative text,
which in Balzac is driven by third-person narration. I am interested
in uncovering the hidden, expansive I. What happens when one
concretizes it, making it evident in the writing, is carnivalesque.
My writing parades various self-conscious positions in regard to
constructs such as authorship, omniscience, and agency. It chooses to
reflect upon the positions it takes and the relations it draws...

The deployment of the I through the autobiographical, the fictive,
abstraction, argumentation is involved in the breaking up of unities.
The I, as I think you are suggesting, does not expand but disperses.
If the text is the social body, the I is mobile within it. If I is
that which is not the body, it attempts to identify with the body's
fleshiness. The I can be a code for seeking pleasure and examining
freedom. Then it becomes troubled by its demands, for the relation of
the self to the world is always troubling; it is never adequate and
the I in its freedom is too willing to give up civility, a cherished
element of comedy.

## Quotes from Gail Scott

### From *Eros The Bittersweet*, by Anne Carson

"...Whenever passion seems within reach, *aidos* falls like a
veil.... This *aidos* is the archaic ethic of 'shamefastness\'. .
. . Ahprodite is the divinity in charge of the perversities of
*aidos* within the novel. She is the chief designer and chief
subverter of the story's changing triangles, both patron and enemy,
inspiring with a passion strong enough to resist all the temptations
that she herself proceeds to hurl against it.... Aphrodite's role
in novels is an ambivalent, not to say paradoxical, one like the role
of Eros in archaic poetry." Eros, p. 79-80

[Carson\'s Greeks lined up Eros versus \'shamefastness,\' which I
contemporaneously interpret not as 'chastity\' but as \'cover-up\';
class has entered discourse: shame is private and social (Scott)]


### From *The Shell and the Kernel* (Vol. 1) by Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok

...What haunts are not the dead, but the gaps left within us by
the secrets of others...
...It is reasonable to maintain that the 'phantom effect\'
progressively fades during its transmission from one generation to
the next and that, finally, it disappears. Yet, this is not at all
the case when shared or complementary phantoms find a way of being
established as social practices along the lines of *staged words*... 
To stage a word, whether metaphorically, as an alloseme, or as a
cryptonym-constitutes an attempt at exorcism, an attempt, that is, to
relieve the unconscious by placing the effects of the phantom in the
social realm.
...The phantom's periodic and compulsive return lies beyond the
scope of symptom formation in the sense of a return of the repressed;
it works like a ventriloquist, like a stranger within the subject's
own mental topography. The imaginings issuing from the presence of a
stranger have nothing to do with fantasy strictly speaking. They
neither preserve a topgraphical status quo nor announce a shift in
it. Instead, by their gratuitousness in relation to the subject, they
create the impression of surrealistic flights of fancy or of
oulipo-like verbal feats.

[I like to think of the phantom dressed up in a cloak studded with
the latest consumer items, on his way to the zoo. I like the play
between contiguity and disjunction implied by attempting to converse
with the unspeakable. This makes strange sentences that swing
"both\" ways, dialoguing with both the uncanny and the social: a
rhetorical edge is added to poetic thinking. (Scott)]

### From *Zoo or Letters Not About Love* by Viktor Shklovsky

...She loved me like her own daughter. When I was two months old,
she fed me cabbage soups and once she managed to poison me by gorging
herself on the pits from the cherry preserves that were being made at
our summer cottage. When I grew up, she came to see me, always with
presents; she remained standing and spoke to me in the formal way;
then, when everyone left, she sat down to drink tea with me and used
the familiar form . When I became an adult, I began to understand her
cheerful disposition: 'My mistress lives with another woman; it\'s
beyond me-just like nuns!' And she\'d roar with laughter\--...She
had a special smell, like her wooden trunk when she lifted the lid:
calico and apples. A tlted nose, knowing eyes...
"One time she was working in a very rich household. The house was
robbed...
Papa asked her: 'And where were you when the house was robbed?\'
'At the Novo-Devichy Convent visiting a nun.\'
'Well, then, tell them and they\'ll let you go.\'
'What? And get a nun mixed up in such business, master!\'
So she didn't say a word, but sat in prison until the thieves were
found and she was released.
Then, after the revolution, Mama tried to persuade her to go vote,
but she said that after that business with the silver spoons, she
wouldn't go near the police station for love or money.

[This passage, though \"authored\" by Sklovsky, is actually by Elsa
Triolet, Shklovsky's beloved at the time. He integrated her letters
into his own fiction. I had intended to quote Shklovsky; whose manner
of stringing together seemingly cut-up prose lines to effect
narrative 'continuity\' is exemplary. Not only shame, but also
authorship, get partly buried here. (Scott)]


### From Lyn Hejinian's Introduction to Jena Osman\'s *Character*

Performance requires the person who is the actor (i.e. already a
character) to be in character, and this, in turn, cannot occur
without performance. This produces not a tautology ("performance
requires performance") but a bifurcation-character occurring as a
performance in and of itself; or, as Osman says (in "The Figural
Cabinet"), \"the taking place is double.\"
Such double-mindedness, which is to say this 'self\'conscious, is
central to Brechtian theater; it forms the basis on which alterities
can come into (the) play. It is characteristic, too, of everyone who
is forced into identity-consciousness, as W.E.B. Du Bois pointed out
long ago in The Souls of Black Folk, a work which itself has been
described (by Houston Baker) as a "cultural performance.\" More
recently, the notion that "identity\" is itself performative has
been greatly elaborated by theorists such as Judith Butler.
Identity-the sense of difference that belongs to one's
self-sameness-is itself "character,\" something that \"takes
place." This means both that it is an occurrence or event-it
happens-and that it involves taking up a position among others (as
might be indicated by stage directions: *Enter Woman, wearing a hat,*
etc.)

## Quotes from Mary Burger

### From *Tristram Shandy*, by Laurence Sterne, first published 1760

#### Chapter V

On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the era fixed on was as
near nine calendar months as any husband could in reason have
expected, --- was I, Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought forth into
this scurvy and disastrous world of ours. --- I wish I had been born
on the Moon, or in any of the planets (except Jupiter or Saturn,
because I never could bear cold weather), for it could not well have
fared worse with me in any of them (though I will not answer for
Venus) than it has in this vile, dirty planet of ours, --- which o'
my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to be made up of
the shreds and clippings of the rest; --- not but the planet is well
enough, provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a
great estate; or could anyhow contrive to be called up to public
charges, and employments of dignity or power; --- but that is not my
case; --- and therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own
market has gone in it; --- for which cause I affirm it over again to
be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made; --- for I can truly
say that from the first hour I drew my breath in it, to this, that I
can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got in skating against
the wind in Flanders, --- I have been the continual sport of what the
world calls fortune; and though I will not wrong her by saying, She
has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil; --- yet
with all the good temper in the world, I affirm it of her that in
every stage of my life, and at every turn and corner where she could
get fairly at me, the ungracious Duchess has pelted me with a set of
as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero
sustained.


#### Chapter VI

In the beginning of the last chapter, I informed you exactly *when* I
was born; --- but I did not inform you *how*. *No*; that particular
was reserved entirely for a chapter by itself; --- besides, Sir, as
you and I are in a manner perfect strangers to each other, it would
not have been proper to have let you into to many circumstances
relating to myself all at once. --- You must have a little patience.
I have undertaken, you see, to write not only my life, but my
opinions also; hoping and expecting that your knowledge of my
character, and of what kind of a mortal I am, by the one, would give
you a better relish for the other: As you proceed further with me,
the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt us will grow
into familiarity; and that, unless one of us is in fault, will
terminate in friendship. --- *O diem praeclarum!* --- then nothing
which has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature, or
tedious in its telling. Therefore, my dear friend and companion, if
you should think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first
setting out, --- bear with me, --- and let me go on, and tell my
story my own way: --- or if I should seem now and then to trifle upon
the road, --- or should sometimes put on a fool's cap with a bell to
it, for a moment or two as we pass along, --- don't fly off, --- but
rather courteously give me credit for a little more wisdom than
appears upon my outside; --- and as we jog on, either laugh with me,
or at me, or in short, do anything, --- only keep your temper.


### From *The Confessions of Saint Augustine*, Trans Edward B. Pusey, D.D. First published c. 400 A.D.

Afterwards I began to smile; first in sleep, then waking: for so it
was told me of myself, and I believed it; for we see the like in
other infants, though of myself I remember it not. Thus, little by
little, I became conscious where I was; and to have a wish to express
my wishes to those who could content them, and I could not; for the
wishes were within me, and they without; nor could they be any sense
of theirs enter within my spirit. So I flung about at random limbs
and voice, making the few signs I could, and such as I could, like,
though in truth very little like, what I wished. And when I was not
presently obeyed (my wishes being hurtful or unintelligible), then I
was indignant with my elders for not submitting to me, with those
owing me no service, for not serving me; and avenged myself on them
by tears. Such have I learnt infants to be from observing them; and
that I was myself such, they, all unconscious, have shown me better
than my nurses who knew it.

Passing hence from infancy, I came to boyhood, or rather it came to
me, displacing infancy. Now did that depart, --- (for wither went
it?) --- and yet it was no more. For I was no longer a speechless
infant, but a speaking boy. This I remember; and have since observed
how I learned to speak. It was not that my elders taught me words
(as, soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by
cries and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express
my thoughts, that so I might have my will, and yet unable to express
all I willed, or to whom I willed, did myself, by the understanding
which Thou, my God, gavest me, practice the sounds in my memory. When
they named any thing, and as they spoke turned towards it, I saw and
remembered that they called what they would point out by the name
they uttered. And that they meant this thing and no other was plain
from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were, of
all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye,
gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice, indicating the
affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or shuns.
And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various
sentences, I collected gradually for what they stood; and having
broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave utterance to my
will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs of our
wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human
life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders.

### From *Our Lady of the Flowers*, by Jean Genet, Trans. Bernard Frechtman,
First published 1943

Our Lady of the Flowers, still and already wearing the light, baggy,
youthful, preposterously tin and, in a word, ghostlike gray-flannel
suit that he was wearing the day of the crime and that he will be
wearing the day of his death, came there to buy a ticket for Le
Havre. Just as he got to the platform, he dropped his wallet which
was stiff with the twenty thousand franc notes. He felt it slip from
his pocket and turned around just in time to see it being picked up
by Darling. Calmly and fatally, Darling examined it, for though he
was a genuine crook, nevertheless he did not know how to be at ease
in original postures and imitated the gangsters of Chicago and
Marseilles. This simple observation also enables us to indicate the
importance of dreaming in the life of the hoodlum, but what I want
particularly to show you by means of it is that I shall surround
myself only with roughnecks of undistinguished personality, with none
of the nobility that comes from heroism. My loved ones will be those
whom you would call "hoodlums of the worst sort.\"

Darling counted the bills. He took ten for himself, put them into his
pocket and handed the rest to Our Lady, who stood there dumbfounded.
They became friends.

I leave you free to imagine any dialogue you please. Choose whatever
may charm you. Have it, if you like, that they hear the voice of the
blood, or that they fall in love at first sight, or that Darling, by
indisputable signs invisible to the vulgar eye, betrays the fact that
he is a thief...Conceive the wildest improbabilities. Have it that
the depths of their being are thrilled at accosting each other in
slang. Tangle them suddenly in a swift embrace or a brotherly kiss.
Do whatever you like.

### From, *Spacetime, Geometry, Cosmology*, William L. Burke, University Science Books, Mill Valley, 1980.


What does it mean to make a model of the universe? We must ask such
questions, even though they seem to belong in the realm of
philosophy, because of the fundamental nature of the subject itself.
A good analogy for this model making is the construction of a map of
a city. The city and the map of the city are two distinct things that
no one would confuse. This confusion is harder to avoid in cosmology.
To be useful, the map must be faithful to some of the city's
interesting properties. Furthermore, the map is constructed according
to some specific conventions: major roads are in red; north is at the
top; and so on. Also, a map does not try to define what a road is.
That you learn by demonstration. People point out roads and non-roads
to you, and you acquire the idea of a road by induction. Such basic
ideas, which are not defined but are learned by demonstration, are
called *primitive notions*.

The same things will be true of the models of physical reality that
we make. We will construct a map of the world according to some
specific but arbitrary conventions. The image is constructed not on
paper, but in terms of some mathematical structure, such as a linear
vector space. Because we can talk about physical reality only in
terms of some model, it is easy for us to forget the distinction
between the object itself and our model of the object. As in our map
of the city, there are some undefined elements in our model. For
spacetime, these primitive notions are *event, free particle, clock,*
and *light signal.* We will describe in words what these correspond
to, much as a roadmap might discuss what it does in fact consider to
be an acceptable road.

An important feature of any model is *coarse-graining.* The model
ignores a lot of things. The exact width, surface, and color of a
road cannot be deduced from the ordinary roadmap. In fact, the
roadmap is more useful than a photograph precisely because it omits
such irrelevant detail. Similarly, there is a coarse-graining in our
primitive notions for spacetime. For example, we will not describe a
clock by making a detailed model of its internal construction. Such
details will not be mentioned. The model presumes that they are
irrelevant, and it is the task of experiment to verify this.


### From *The Passion*, Jeanette Winterson, Vintage Books, 1989

Lovers are not at their best when it matters. Mouths dry up, palms
sweat, conversation flags and all the time the heart is threatening
to fly from the body once and for all. Lovers have been known to have
heart attacks. Lovers drink too much from nervousness and cannot
perform. They eat too little and faint during their fervently wished
consummation. They do not stroke the favoured cat and their
face-paint comes loose. This is not all. Whatever you have set store
by, your dress, your dinner, your poetry, will go wrong.

How is it that one day life is orderly and you are content, a little
cynical perhaps but on the whole just so, and then without warning
you find the solid floor is a trapdoor and you are now in another
place whose geography is uncertain and whose customs are strange.

Travellers at least have a choice. Those who set sail know that
things will not be the same as at home. Explorers are prepared. But
for us, who travel along the blood vessels, who come to the cities of
the interior by chance, there is no preparation. We who were fluent
find life is a foreign language. Somewhere between the swamp and the
mountains. Somewhere between fear and sex. Somewhere between God and
the Devil passion is and the way there is sudden and the way back is
worse.

I'm surprised at myself for talking in this way. I\'m young, the
world is before me, there will be others. I feel my first streak of
defiance since I met her. My first upsurge of self. I won't see her
again. I can go home, throw aside these clothes and move on. I can
move out if I like. I'm sure the meat man can be persuaded to take
me to Paris for a favour or two.

> Passion, I spit on it.

# Kathy Acker: The Killers





**I wrote a piece** today and it's really just the beginning of something
on narration. I've got time trouble because of overwork. You know:
you're broke, and you take on too much work, and then you fuck up on
everything. It's never ending.


So understand this is simple and it's the beginning of something. You
know, it's totally open rather than anything else.


And I thought we were going to touch on two issues talking about
narration. One is identity. That's an obvious issue, the business
about who am I---you know, this is all postmodernist shit. What,
therefore, is real? Is there any real? And the other issue is raised
by the quote from this little card that advertises this panel about
writing for century's end. Constantly there's this trouble hovering
in the air. The immediacy of all the danger we're living in, of the
possible end of both humanism and of humanity, that we might all be
going the way of the dinosaurs very fast. And that culture is going
the way of? of whatever---dinosaur culture. And when we talk about
writing these two things, these issues hover there.


But let me start, since we're talking about narration, by telling you
a story. Very simple. My story begins with my friend Bob Glück who one
day, once upon a time, as story structure goes, told me that he has a
certain habit. A habit of circumventing his own habits by asking his
friends to give him a reading lesson. What should he, Bob Glück, read?
Perhaps in order to improve himself, or perhaps in order to do the
opposite. So Bob Glück goes to Kevin Killian, another friend, "Kevin,
what do you want me to read?"


Kevin replies, "'The Killers,' by Ernest Hemingway."


Upon hearing this story, for this is a story, I replied, "Oh Bob, how
weird, Hemingway?"


"Not weird" replies Bob. "All the English students at San Francisco
State love Hemingway."


Two nights after this happened I had the following dream. First, I
have to tell you a few details about my childhood and about before my
childhood in order to elucidate this dream for you. I never met my
father. Though he was married to my mother, he left her when she was
three months pregnant with me.


When I was 26 years old, through an accident, I traced my father's
family. I wrote to them and they wrote back that they would accept me
into their family and we arranged to meet. I thought that I was going
to meet my real father, but I only met the first cousin. He told me
(and I think he was a little crazy---well not crazy but eccentric,
because rich people are never crazy), that perhaps I should not meet
my father. Why? Because my father had murdered someone who was
trespassing on his yacht. After remaining six months in a lunatic
asylum, the state had excused him of any murder charge. My father then
disappeared. No one now knew where he was, said the first cousin. And
so I abandoned my search for my father, for my life at that time was
hard enough, and this new trouble was simply not worth the trouble.


When I was 30 years old, my mother suicided.


Enough of my childhood.


I had the following dream: I dreamt that I was looking for my real
father. In my dream, I knew that it was dumb for me to do this because
my father was dead. Since I'm not dumb, I or the dreamer thought, I
must be trying to find my father so that I can escape from this house
which is being run by a woman. I go to a private detective. He calls
me a dame.


I say, "I'm looking for my father."


The private detective, who might be a friend, replies that my case is
an easy one. I like that I'm easy. We begin our search. According to
his instructions, I tell this private eye everything that I know about
my mystery. It takes me several days for me to recount all the
details. It was summertime in Dallas. Everything was yellow. I didn't
remember anything about this first period of my life, about my
childhood. After this not remembering, I remembered jewels. As soon as
my mother passed away, a jewel case was opened. The case, consisting
of one tray, had insides of red velvet. Perhaps I'm dreaming my
mother's cunt. I'm given a jewel which is green. I don't know where
that jewel is now. I have no idea what happened to it. This is the
mystery of which I'm speaking.


The private eye pursued my matter. A couple of days later he came up
with my father's name: Olen. This name means nothing to me.


"Olen. Your father's name is Olen. Furthermore, your father killed
your mother."


I thought, in order to dismiss thought, that's possible. The
detective continued to give me details about my father. He's from
Iowa, and of Danish blood. All this could be true, because how can I
know anything?


Now when I woke up out of this dream, I remembered details about my
mother's suicide. She had killed herself eight days before Christmas.
A note in her handwriting, lying beside her dead body, said that her
white poodle was staying with such and such veterinarian. Nothing
else. But despite this note the cops were convinced that my mother was
murdered by a man whose name wasn't known. Nevertheless, it was
Christmas and there wasn't going to be any police investigation
because the cops wanted to return to their homes, Christmas warmth,
and holiday.


For the first time ever in my life I had the following thought: My
father could have murdered my mother. After all, what if my real
father is crazy? At that moment I became very scared. If my father did
murder my mother, he could now be planning to murder me.


Now last week I was touring around and I found myself on a gig in
Roanoke, Virginia, where I met this absolutely wonderful writer,
Richard Dillard, and Richard told me that when he had been a boy he
had encountered his first proposition by a man during a showing of
"The Killers" at a local Roanoke theater.


That's the end of the story.


Also I should mention that in "The Killers" the name of the Swede
who's about to be slaughtered by those killers is Olen.


Now, is this a story, what I've just told you? Certainly it's
narrative, right? And each incident actually did happen. That is, it
was real. But a story? Stories are about something. And what I've
just told you---it's not about anything. It's not even about me. A
story, you see, a story has something to do with realism, and what
I've just told you, though each little bit was real or had happened,
has nothing to do with realism.


Listen to another voice as we proceed on this treasure hunt, or
narration. The voice of Julio Cortasar.


"Almost all the stories I have written belong to the genre called
fantastic, for lack of a better word, and are opposed to that false
realism that consists of believing that everything can be described
and explained, as was assumed by the optimism of 19th century
philosophy and science. That is, as part of a world governed more or
less harmoniously by a system of laws, principles, cause and effect
relations, well-defined psychologies, etc." That lovely world
order---that governing harmoniously by all these principles---we all
know is now over. Though Bill Clinton has a hype.


Okay, a little more on realism. Richard Dillard rightly calls that
narrative structuring named realism "reductive."


"But isn't that the central story of 19th century realistic
fiction?" he exclaims in his review of Alester Grey's marvelous
novel **Poor Things**. "The central story of realistic fiction: we
are born, we are misshaped by biological inheritance, economic forces
beyond our control, and cultural biases beyond our recognition, and
finally we die with our failed dreams on our dry lips."


Realism: reductive and dehumanizing.


"There's another order," says Cortesar, "more secret and less
communicable. That the true study of reality lay not in laws but in
the exceptions to those laws has been the guiding principle in my
personal search for literature beyond all naive realism."


Now return to the narration that I told you. I can't even say what
it's about: Bob Glück's conversation, my dream about my real father,
Richard Dillard's memory. Where in this narration lies the real? It
lies in the connections between the three sections; in the connections
between the "real" events and the holes, the silences. In the
slippages. Slippages into what?


In Moby Dick, Melville speaks of reality as the interstices through
which all of us fall. There's another, a further way of putting this,
of proceeding on our treasure hunt. These interstices can be named
chaos, or places where language cannot be, or death. When
storytelling, humans attempt to cling to meaning. I think of
narration, of narrative, or that narrative which tries to encounter
the real, as that which is negotiating between two orders of time:
clock time and chaos. The writer is playing---when structuring
narrative or when narrative is structuring itself---with life and
death. He or she is maneuvering between order and disorder, between
meaning and meaninglessness and so is making literature.


However, these movements between clock time and chaos in written
narrative are more structurally complex. To begin, consider one aspect
of time in the novel: time. What? The time it takes to write a novel.
A novel's a big thing. I'm talking about novel narration at the
moment because that's what I deal with. It usually takes at least a
year, often many years. During that time the writer's life changes.
So there's the time of all the actual changes the writer is going
through---the time it takes to write the novel.


Two: the time it takes to read a novel. A novel is very rarely
something you read in one sitting. So that time it takes to read a
novel incorporates all the readers memories, all the interstices of
time, the time lapses between readings, all the returns to earlier
parts of the novel, etc. Three: the fictive time. The time within the
story or the narrations. Even Hopscotch---there's fictive time there.
So in this sense a novel, structurally, is a time triad.


Rather than continue with this---and you can start analyzing
novelistic structure---I want to just quickly skip to a final point.
Consider again realism. And I must say the more I think about it, I
think writing is more and more about time. Consider again this thing
of realism (I'd like to abandon the whole thing). Within the realm of
realism lies the assumption that language mirrors all that isn't
language, right? A table. That what a narrative is about: telling what
is or should be true. That a narrative mirrors reality.


Now do I need to say---how simplistic. But what I want to ask is, why
bother being so simplistic? Why bother with the lie of realism? Why
bother being so miserable, reductive, when one could play? If I'm
going to tell you what the real is by mirroring it, by telling you a
story which expresses reality, I'm attempting to tell you how things
are. By letting you see through my own eyes, I give you my viewpoints,
moral and political. In other words, realism is simply a control
method. Realism doesn't want to negotiate, open into, even know chaos
or the body or death. Because those who practice realism want to limit
their readers' perceptions, want to limit perceptions to a
centric---which in this society is always a phallocentric---reality.
"I am the one," says the realistic writer, "I'm telling you
reality." And we can talk. I have the same quarrel about narrowing
anything to single identity.


In other words, behind every literary or cultural issue lies the
political, the realm of political power. And whenever we talk about
narration, narrative structure, we're talking about political power.
There are no ivory towers. The desire to play, to make literary
structures which play into and in unknown or unknowable realms, those
of chance and death and the lack of language, is the desire to live in
a world that is open and dangerous, that is limitless. To play, then,
both in structure and in content, is to desire to live in wonder.

**As a child I was told** that not knowing the alphabet will cause
illiteracy. It'll send you into a drugged out gangland life of white
trash nightmares and corner boy peddling to homosexuals, who are
professional players, obsessed with age and are willing to drag it and
you into emptiness. That in knowing the letters, Ill know that they
assemble to construct various images that become words. Words are the
narrative transformation of the images. Printing a page of unbroken
words is like a fresh tattoo. It captures a moment/place, sentiment
and period. It orchestrates the body in motion as it flexes to move a
pen/strike at a key/form a fist/lift a drink or move to a rhythm. The
words become the unspoken intertextuality of ethnic, racial and
cultural metaphoric speech. The metre of casual dialogue = a
rhythm/noise/visual/bass, a soundtrack to a post-literate train of
thought.

I dedicated **Wigger** to the sound of Slayer and Sonic
Youth---"Bloodland" to Cannibal Corpse (George "Corpsegrinder"
Fisher) = I dedicated them to sound. Slayer is for the fury and speed
and violence that the book has. Deathmetal is the living desire of the
neo-redneck burnout. It's all going after the sport of
brutality---the art of hurting someone. The walking jokes, with
targets on their backs, placed there by lilbitches, taking them for Mn
Ms. The only violence is, the way the words appear on the page, marked
by the slashes that connote rhythm of speech and interrupted thought.
They are like semi-colons = / the // are colons and so are the =
signs. Sometimes the - move out to separate speech---someone takes
lead//does a solo. Sonic Youth's sounds appear in the form of the
book dissolving. Deathmetal is just dealing with the situation. The
book and the story, like the characters, are trying to hold themselves
together. Brian and Jerehmia symbolize this the most. They talk. No
one listens.

...a printer ejects swatches of stolen tissue that collects the sound
and images of what is considered low brow art and skill//

Hardcore (H.C.)/Country/Rockabilly

Thrash and Speedmetal/Rap/Deathmetal/Blackmetal

Cinema/Television and;

Comics Books

Brian appears to be rambling but he makes the most sense because he
speaks through metaphor and his heart, like Black speech and
song---the negro spiritual, seeming to sing about a river,

when it is a code,

for an escape,

at a certain time,

from the plantation.

Gangsta rap seems to boast

about an evening

or event

but is just shouting

validity,

existence and

enterprise.

Brians grasp on reality becomes inconsequential.

Jerehmias story is dumbshow.

Brian surrenders his ideals and his soul, by killing Spook (the Black
hustler friend).

Jerehmia is just having his taken and he's telling you about it---but
I knew people in Atlanta that didn't want to hear about any of that
or them. I knew a boy from Tennessee hurting worst than what was going
as oppression under those 100 dollar Afro centric hats.

...Wordcore, Jamaican dub poetry, Rap and Rock Steady are disposed to
the Homeric boasts and catalogues of post-modern thugs/hoodlums and
desperadoes w/ the hope of kindness and compassion.

In donning the Black persona, symbolized through the silver jacket,
Brian finally does what everyone has been attempting to do throughout
the book. Brian is killed---his soul is killed, through the burden of
the weight of the Black youth---the Black persona, the persona of
deglamoured oppression. He has achieved the goal of being Black but he
is unprepared to handle something that the Blacks are raised to deal
with through centuries of struggle---youd suppose.

I met a boy with crystal smack grey eyes, who was offering to suck the
fender (for $5) off an urban assault vehicle for a painkiller.

If you listen and see the page, you'll see a tattoo and note well,
that some words are//

-Rhythm

-Lead and

-Bass

Jerehmia, he has no desire to be Black. He knows what the shit is and
he's got his own. He just watches the seemingly liberal Perry go
catch back the Black boy trying to bail on the whole scene. He just
knows that nothing that's happening, is about him or the niglet.
It's about the little men with big shirts and the chicks in bed or
sitting off from the Bar b q..

...strange how all the youngmen holding up walls waiting on passers
by had deep drawls, no smiles and trailers in their hearts.

The book and the story are collapsing. The spaces and sparsness of the
narrative is there to get you to listen carefully and read again and
close read and not take things at face value. People say more,
especially, when they've had a lifetime of hurt, through very few
words and the words look in ways that they feel---speeching in
accapella. The words sound the way they feel. The book shows patterns
of speech.

Mcluhan would argue the global village: technology is good---the book
people are lacking in the rich grammar of the TV = This is referred to
today as the post-literate generation---John Cages bastard children
turn to violence and the acoustic space of video and computer games
and the delicacy of words typed over television screens.

Mcluhan would argue...

The Comic book uses frames and juxtaposition to connect the
disconnectedness of thought and words, be it through the gruff
noireness of Frank Miller, Dave Sim or Martin Wales "Kinder Nacht,"
or the smooth lines, colours and ruff justice of Todd McFarlane. They
collect the street sounds and activities the way Rap culture
manipulates and emulates, via spin art and samples, the ready made
terror of interurban life. To frame is to make perfect the moment of
the fingers striking the keys, which can be the repetition of words
and phrases = outlets ripping and shredding, w/ the knowledge that
framing is certainly an attempt to make perfect, to make the words as
enticing and elegant as the bovine euphony of a fascist's goose step.

Brian is condemned to sit, numbed out on pills, in a room, filled with
drag queens, watching them transform. Just like Brian's desire, and
the other characters desires, to be Black, the drag queens attempt to
be women, without knowing, that beyond the glamour, is a lot of
hardship and struggle. Drag queens die, as well, when they finally
achieve their dream of being a woman. It's not as much fun or better
than they thought it would be. They are unprepared for the daily
struggle and threats. You can see this on the page. They are boxed in,
allowing themselves to be, finally, separated from the freeness and
flow of the book. They must stay within the parameters. The glamour is
gone. They have to bear the actual pain. Brian has got the auditory
recollection of rape in his head. Brian is numb. Sos Jerehmia, but
he's numb from the beginning, any way. Hes just recollecting,
now---no need to figure. He cant hold it together, nor does he want
to. His flag is upside down, Oswalds dead---nothings right. You
separate the body from the mind and its all good.

...a word can be the hums or bops in the background as when a funk
musician beats the strings w/ his thumb---the buzz and scratch of a
tat gun on a steadied arm or back---the stilled breath and firm muscle
of a word or image engraved on a belly. It gets tied into the
paragraph. Some words take on the repetitive ecstatic riff of ska or
reggae or the decay of the crash/noise of H.C. or metal. They recline
on the page or in the air as if they were all going to amount to a
junkies last sigh. Instead, they collapse into the lost, disorientated
and somewhat satisfied image of Orsen Wells after thrashing a room at
Xanadu.

...and the book and story crumble into a final sustained note, done
through a note to Andrew from Jerry. "Bloodland" has a crack of gun
shot and shit and a heart beat. As it began on a note---it ends. His
(Jerrys) speech is proper and distant from the language of the book.
He has become a literary character of the Modernist sense.

Jerking the Modernist approach to distance, into "groovy times," is
the dumbshow to the contemporary adoration of the absurdist tragic
comedy = anti-romantic. It presents itself, today, through the jaded
situationism of talkshow culture. The sort that "Blast" and
"Counter Blast" utilized through the headlines and print of
newspapers. The newspapers place horror and glory side by side in a
folio that has a calculated randomness. It will always assemble to
state 1 thing = these events happen. It is only through such genres of
media (music/comic/print/television), that we can see that each has a
thing in common/coupons and advertising = rhetoric and metaphor. If
the passage of a text takes on the sound and image of the
disjointedneness of casual speech and media, then the results are not
only the coded tales being woven, but the presentation of the
brutality that leads to the violent outcome.

Jerehmia, he just figures...hes just feedback from a bass, right now.

**Wigger** and "Bloodland" are what the printer jetted out---a
conceptual pastiche alphabet from the corner or gutter. It assembles
the images in sequence which persuades the narrative to be pulled out
from under a character. Its what got them blocked off---formatted,
layed out, then pile-drived with carefully selected skin grafts of
onomatopoeias. The words takes Audens diver, diving w/ his brilliant
bow and takes it beyond the enthralled spectator. They suppose that he
has forgotten to test the water and has come out a dumb struck
paraplegic = what just happened/where are our people/who are our
people/do we have any people: NO. However, they still keep tabs on the
moment, place sound and period that left the object devastated, hung
over, and w/ an image permanently scratched and coloured onto his
flesh or hanging in a window.--

Oi Cheers,

Laz



# Mary Burger: Flange or Premises



**Can I say it went on** for a week. Can I say I woke up each day, and
went through each day,

"You were there, and you were there, and you, and you!"

Word went out, a consciousness with a consistency, looked at itself
looking at itself, halted the infinite regress, the mirror facing the
mirror, a language made possible a belief in location.

I wanted to speak as someone who had experiences. I wanted to speak as
someone who knew others. To have things happen, and to speak of them,

someone told a story to which I was unable to respond. The story was
the story itself.

 

I want the other thing. Hinges and holes and string. The impossible
appearing to be,

an engine, a large machine, an apparatus, a stage for a scene.

 

Can it be a narrator who doubts its premises?

# David Buuck: Despite

**One narrative theory** is that Agents are social beings. Equidistant
from Los Alamos and Roswell, the artist Walter de Maria places poles
in the landscape in order to construct a grid. The land is not the
setting for the work but a part of the work. The poles are angled at
eighty-eight degrees else lightening always strikes twice. The primary
experience takes place within the grid. Weather is total.

One narrative theory is that social beings are agents. The grid is the
imaginary frame by which it becomes possible to sense the spatial
landscape. The grid dwarfs Agents, the grid in turn being dwarfed by
the landscape, provoking Agents to realize their own relation to the
spatial landscape. In that the grid itself cannot be comprehended in
its totality, neither can the spatial landscape. Castles are sand that
can't be shelter to kings. In that the spatial landscape cannot be
comprehended in totality, neither can there be kings. Rabbits nibbling
on apple cores are nervously aware that there can't be shelter from
weather. Humility is nervous awareness of Agents not being rabbits.

There are three agents in the landscape who are not kings. The
Agents' relation to the grid becomes paramount. Agent A's scale
becomes paramount. Agent B's silence becomes paramount. Agent C's
isolation becomes paramount. Humility is nervous awareness of Agents
not being kings. The invisible is real.

The spatial relation of sky to the landscape is such that the clouds
are pressed flat against an imaginary plane of glass. The imaginary
plane rests upon the grid. One narrative theory is that Agents' minds
function as the imaginary plane. The action is the air and wind and
rain. So-called natural elements are grounding such that Agents'
social being, in isolation, in being dwarfed, is grounded. That this
is not separate from Agents' social being, but rather central to
Agents' realization as social beings, is one effect. Rabbits nibbling
on apple cores are nervously aware that lightening always strikes
twice. Humility is nervous awareness of Agents not being total. The
primary experience takes place within the social grid. Distance is
total.

One narrative theory is that one never dies in photographs.
Equidistant from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the artist Kenji Yanobe
builds nuclear-safe capsules within which he is photographed while
being in Chernobyl. That the artist Kenji Yanobe would be in Chernobyl
inhabiting sculptural objects for the ostensible sake of safety is
troubling to one. That the photographs of the artist Kenji Yanobe
inside nuclear-safe capsules while being in Chernobyl are
aesthetically pleasing is troubling to one.

One narrative theory is that in desiring the apocalypse it is
continually deferred. The artist Kenji Yanobe builds nuclear-safe
capsules for sexual acts. Such acts are expressed outward as
exhalations of perfumed music, compressed air modulated through
anthropomorphic trumpets, so-called safe sex ironized into cartoon
farts. That nuclear-safe capsules for sexual acts are aesthetically
pleasing is troubling to one.

One narrative theory is that one's apocalypse is inside. Such
apocalypse is not nuclear-safe, such sex is disharmonious, such art is
a cartoon that is actual. Agents inside nuclear-safe capsules are not
safe from themselves. Agents cannot be insulated in machines that are
cartoon, in art that farts its own radioactivity.

There are three Agents in the capsules who are not cartoons. Agent
Yellow breathes its own air. Agent Red eats its own waste. Agent
Orange is the machine that desires its own apocalypse. That the
technology necessary to provide safety for Agents is the same
technology that produces the effects from which Agents desire safety
is troubling, three, two, one. Castles are cartoon machines that
can't be shelter to kings. There are no kings, only agents.

## 3

The sky is always in relation to Agents' landscape. Even underground,
though that's a dream. In dreams Agents' own minds are the relation
of the imaginary plane to Agents' own underground landscape. The
grid's only function is to provoke Agents' realization of Agents'
own landscape in actuality. The grid exists so as to become invisible.
The grid exists so that it doesn't have to. The invisible is real.
Dreams are real. Shelter is context.

One narrative theory is that the sun never sets. Agent Yellow, from a
distance, disappears into the landscape. Agent Red is still
disappearing, though Agent Orange is still here. Perspective is
constitutive of Agents' social being. Agents have different
perspectives that are relational. Total perspective is ideology that
can't be shelter to kings. Perspective is constitutive of Agents'
social bearing. Context is shelter.

Being dwarfed is perspective that reduces distances between social
beings. Relations between social beings provoke social bearings within
the grid. Roswell and Los Alamos are two landscapes that provoke such
social bearings. That the historical landscape dwarfs Agents,
provoking such social bearings, is troubling to one. Hiroshima and
Nagasaki are two landscapes that provoke such social bearings. Social
bearings realize social grids that produce the social landscape. That
Agent A might become grounded, in its isolation, is one effect. That
Agent B might become grounded, in its social being, is one effect.
That Agent C might become grounded, in its social bearings, is one
effect. The social grid is constructed by the many social beings. Its
construction is relational to the many social bearings. Perspective
dwarfs the historical landscape. The sun never sets.

Dystopia is this topia, the cynically willed non-place of the
apocalyptic imaginary. Its filmy visuals are projected onto the
imaginary plane of glass that rests upon the social grid. The sky is
the image of the impending apocalypse. Its spectral traces appear
transparent when viewed from the ground up. The sky is always falling,
else the bottom falls out. Social beings labor at constructing the
grid to support the imaginary plane. Agent-sweat is radioactive.
Agents drink it as refreshment while awaiting the coming attractions.

One narrative theory is that one never dies in film. At the end of a
long day of grid-building it is nice to lie on the ground and watch
the bottom of the sky fall onto the imaginary plane. The ground is the
imaginary plane of consciousness upon which social beings construct
the social grid. Ideology is the nightmare made material by certain
social bearings. The ideological grid exists so that it might become
invisible. The ideological grid exists so that it doesn't have to.
The invisible is reel-to-reel.

One narrative theory is that Agents are never awake, except in
history. So-called nightmares are in actuality the history that Agents
desire to have been merely dreamt. Underground is the collective
repressed. At night it dreams itself through rabbit-holes into the
social grid. One narrative theory is that one never dies in dreams.
Rabbits nibbling at nuclear cores are nervously aware that history
always strikes twice. Humility is nervous awareness of Agents awaking
from dreams and being in history.

The artist Kenji Yanobe's sculptural objects, in that they provide
habitation, in the form of objects of safety and art, while at the
same time being distancing, in that Agents are further distanced from
the actual world, while still being in it, are troubling to one. That
the artist Kenji Yanobe would be in Chernobyl inhabiting sculptural
objects for the ostensible sake of art is troubling to one. That the
art necessary to provide safety for Agents is the same art that
produces the effects from which Agents desire safety, is troubling,
four, three, agents, two, one. Agents are never safe from themselves.

The artist Kenji Yanobe's photographs, in that they document art
providing safety, while at the same time being distancing, in that
they are further distanced from Chernobyl, while still being in it,
are troubling to one. The photographs are viewed outside of Chernobyl,
in place of Chernobyl, as art and as safety. They are already
happening, though in actuality they are not Chernobyl. Distance is
safety. There's no distance in actuality. There's no safety.

The artist Kenji Yanobe has not yet built nuclear-safe capsules for
rabbits nibbling apple cores. One narrative theory is that nervous
awareness is not enough to prevent an apple core breach. That the wind
from Chernobyl might kill the rabbits is troubling, four, them, three,
to one. That the repeated vocalization of "Chernobyl" might become
aesthetically pleasing by virtue of its repetition is troubling to
one. There are sixty-six dead rabbits in the grid. Their bottoms have
fallen out.

## 6

Sentry posts guard the perimeter. Their dogs are in nuclear-safe
capsules, making it difficult to chase the rabbits. Acid rain leaks
into the underground reservoir. Social beings labor into a future that
is still undecided. Agent-sweat is radioactive. Agents drink it as
refreshment while awaiting the sky to fall. One narrative theory is
that the sentry posts face in rather than out. Each pole waves a flag
advertising the coming attractions. One narrative theory is that there
is no perimeter.

Social beings that are also rabbits that live in underground bomb
shelters. Castles made of pamphlet bomb shreddings can't be shelter
for rabbit-kings. Rabbits have infrared night vision that always
strikes twice. They drink from the radioactive reservoir that runs
from Roswell to Los Alamos. That the wind from Los Alamos might kill
the rabbits is troubling to one. The sentries put the sixty-six dead
rabbits into piles to climb up and up. Else the bottom would fall out.
That the repeated vocalization of "Los Alamos" might become
aesthetically pleasing by virtue of its repetition is troubling five,
four, three, to one.

One narrative theory is that dreams are underground nuclear tests.
They mushroom into consciousness through rabbit-holes and
anthropomorphic trumpets. Cartoon farts are air-raid sirens that go up
and up. The music is the bomb. It makes the bottom fall out.

## 7

The underground compartment containing radioactive warheads is called
"The Pit". The warheads are angled at eighty-eight degrees, else the
bottom falls out. Agent-sweat is radioactive. Agents drink it as
refreshment while awaiting the bottom to fall out. That the bottom
would fall out onto Agents' heads is troubling, six, five, four,
three, troubling to one.

One narrative theory is that there is an underground nightclub called
"The Pit," where rabbits push up and up. The player piano is
programmed to perform eighty-eight degrees of sound, else the bottom
falls out. Music is the distance of time within sound's detonation.
The speed of sound is measured by the distance between lightening and
its thunder. Agent Yellow never strikes twice. Agent Red is not a
rocket scientist. Agent Orange is the bomb.

The speed of sound is measured by the distance between the bomber and
the detonation of its payload. The warhead is programmed to perform
eighty-eight degrees of separation. Its coin slides into its slot. Its
music is the bomb, whose bottom falls out. The speed of light is
measured by the detonation of the bomb within Agents' own bottoms
falling out.

One narrative theory is that one never dies in sculpture. Kenji
Yanobe's sculptural objects evoke a nostalgia for an apocalypse that
never happened. It is a nostalgia for the future of a past that is
continually deferred to a present that hasn't happened yet. It's
already happening. The so-called-and-ever-wished-for last instance
never arrives, and yet the present is-and-always-is this very last
instance. The apocalypse is always happening.

One narrative theory is that one consumes or is consumed. The artist
Kenji Yanobe has produced a never-ending simulation of a survival cart
race, which will protect Agents from radioactivity as long as Agents
keep inserting coins into their nuclear-safe capsules. Agents must
exit the capsule in order to insert the coins into its exterior
anthropomorphic coin slots. There is no future here, only the present
which enables Agents to survive as long as Agents keep consuming. The
rabbits chew through the string that is used for the coin-slot coin
trick. The only safety is to insert coins into another's coin slots
in hopes that the other will do the same. Distance is the opposite of
safety.

The artist Kenji Yanobe stands at the sentry post facing out, toward
the ruins of the future. Rabbits have infrared vision that can see
through the nuclear-safe capsule. The inside is lined with rabbit fur.
It's a never-ending simulation of eighty-eight degrees inside.
Agent-sweat is radioactive. Agents drink it as refreshment while
awaiting the survival cart race.

## 9

The social grid exists so as to become invisible. The social grid
exists so that it doesn't have to. That the invisibility of the
social grid might provoke the realization of the ideological landscape
is troubling to one. Even underground, though that's a dream. The
so-called social elements are the imaginary plane of social beings.
The imaginary plane stretches out into the distance, held up by the
many social beings. History never disappears.

The imaginary plane reaches from one pole to the next, grounded by the
many social bearings. The present disappears into the historical
landscape, though it's still here. That such disappearance into the
historical landscape might be the forgetting of social bearings is
troubling to one. Even underground, though that's a dream. History is
the imaginary plane of social bearings. Here it is now, stretching out
into the distance, held up by the many social bearings.

The social grid extends indefinitely into the future. Social beings
labor at building it outward. The apocalypse of totality is
continually deferred. Humility is nervous awareness that Agents are
grid-workers. That the social bearings necessary to destroy the grid
are the same social bearings that build the grid is troubling, eight,
seven, six, five, four, three, agents, troubling, to, one.

## 10

The Agents are in their survival carts. The carts fart perfumed
radioactivity through anthropomorphic trumpets. Agent Orange breathes
its own air. The music is air-raid sirens that go up and up. The
rabbits' infrared vision burns through the string that is used for
the coin-slot coin trick. Agent Red eats its own waste. It's a
never-ending simulation of eighty-eight degrees inside. Agent Yellow
drinks its own sweat. Agent-sweat is radioactive. Agents drink it as
refreshment while awaiting the coins to run out.

Agent A puts its coin into Agent B's coin slot. Agent B puts its coin
into Agent C's coin slot. Agent C puts its coin into Agent A's coin
slot. There are no kings to make more coins, so the grid-poles are
dismantled and melted into currency. Without the poles, the imaginary
plane's bottom falls out. The grid collapses into itself. The
perimeters collapse into their centers. Agents trade in their
narrative theories for the few remaining coins. The sun is setting.
The social bearings are detonated. In the last instance coins fall to
the ground in piles that go up and up. The sky is falling.

Agent Yellow's survival cart is red. Agent Red's survival cart is
orange. Agent Orange's survival cart is yellow. As they collapse into
one another, the detonation provokes the sunset. From a distance the
shutters click shut. That the sunset is a film that is aesthetically
pleasing is troubling, ten, nine, eighty-eight degrees, seven,
sixty-six rabbits, five, four, whom, three, agents, troubling, to,
one. Action.


## Postscript

One narrative theory is that there is always another narrative theory.
Action is choosing. The film reel is stuck in the machine. The
so-called sunset is merely the melting celluloid of one possible
future. The machine is the apocalyptic imaginary that desires its own
foreclosure. Agent Orange has killed off Agents A and B, Agents Red
and Yellow. But Agent C has managed to elude such foreclosure. New
grids are being constructed by social beings with different social
bearings. Action is choosing made material by certain social bearings.
Humility is nervous awareness that action is total. It's already
happening.

One narrative theory is that one never dies in writing. The writing
cannot in actuality provide safety. It is a machine desiring its own
apocalypse. In actuality it is its own social being, desiring its own
narrative theory. Here it is now, stretching out into the distance,
held up by its social bearings. Agent C is writing itself onto the
imaginary plane. The script has yet to be finished. It's already
happening.

 



# Jacques Debrot: Narrative is boring



**Narrative is boring** because it precludes the direct actualization of
the world through our perception. But there is no alternative;
narrative is both a disabling and a necessary condition of perception.
For this reason, boredom is the affective condition that writing
predominantly negotiates and exploits. However, it has always struck
me that boredom, despite its stigmatization, is, in reality, a
complexly ambivalent emotion. Somewhere Roland Barthes--in **Roland
Barthes** I believe---describes boredom, suggestively, as a form
hysteria (or is it stupidity that he calls hysterical?). Whatever the
case, I try to make my writing both as boring and as stupid as I
possibly can---in Barthes' words, "I agree to pluralize myself, to
permit free cantons of stupidity to live inside me." Error, play, bad
taste, incomprehension, artifice, and a lack of truth or
reasonableness are, thus, the narrative potentialities I attempt to
fulfill.

Paradoxically, with the loss of narrative's legitimizing and
explanatory functions, in much of the most interesting contemporary
writing there has been an increasing recourse to, rather than a
retreat from, narrative forms. My own work is transversed by multiple,
parataxic narratives and entangled discourses. Ideally (and
impossibly) I would like to produce a narrative that would need to be
read in the same way one "reads" a painting; that is, by orienting
oneself gradually, by means of various intensities and expressive
deformations of surface---the textual equivalents, if they exist, of
the mechanisms of collaging, dribbling, scraping, scratching,
scumbling, attaching, interposing, reversing, permutting, and so
on---to the entire environment and atmosphere of the writing; a method
aligned not so much with an aesthetics of fragmentation, but rather,
one that proceeds through the *accretion* and flux of many ephemeral
ruptures and stases.

This, obviously, entails a fundamental reconsideration of what is
traditionally classified as narrative form. However, for me, the
central question is not a taxanomical, or a typological one. More
important than the question of whether writing such as mine is
narrative, is the problem of how, in what sense, this writing can be
read as narrative.

The situation of communication---the roles of author and reader, the
relations of subject positions within the narrative itself, as well as
the historical contexts in which the meanings of the narrative
circulate---cannot be excluded from the kind of reading my work
attempts to invite. But even more specifically, I am interested by the
aesthetic situation in which my writing occurs. By this I mean I am
concerned most of all with my feelings, and with my tastes and my
preferences. Like everyone's, my experience of art, as Thierry du
Duve argues, "begins and ends with aesthetic judgement." It is
impossible---at least on aesthetic grounds---to be insincere to one's
tastes. However our preferences are not objective, and our feelings,
although they are our own, are also social constructions. Inasmuch as
literature and narrative are no longer given domains but generative
practices, what I want to experience in the act of writing, or reading
is to feel, as du Duve puts it, the conflict of values both within
myself, and within and for the cultural field as a conflict of
feelings, "to give in to the reflexive feeling of dissent. . . . To
give my consent to the felt absence of concensus."

It is this ongoing dissent--that is to say, my resistance to any
single unitary or consummating construction---that *is* the self from
which, as much as the goal toward which, I write.

**I've started with this** top-heavy loading of quotations to highlight a
general movement from textualization of (generally) the "outside
world" and place/site alongside a similar movement within (generally)
art and site-specific art in order to establish a frame to address how
the "place" of writing and cultural production could be
rearticulated. Aside from a poststructuralist tendency to read
structures as texts, how does this "textual turn" implicate writing
as a constructive act? Has the modernist literary project of writing
an imagined world been deflected through poststructuralism so now the
world is imagined as not only written, but as text?

Parallel to this "textual turn," which leads intriguingly to Mowing
Kwon's vague "discursive vectors," there has been both a related
mapping impulse and a constructive intent directed at "place." The
mapping impulse is both ontological and geographic (writing as a
mapping of a mind or of subjectivity, writing as part of the process
of realizing "place"). In popular media, texts, particularly novels,
are given a primarily ontological role, of telling us something about
the places we live in, and by extension to tell us something about
"ourselves" or to illuminate the author as subject. Geographically,
the constructive intent is perhaps clearest in a national
literature's assembling of images and icons to create the imagined
place of a nation and to the related levels of regional literatures
and urbanist texts.

In contemporary art, a sort of sociological turn and mapping has
emerged. Hal Foster cites Dan Graham"s "Homes for America" which
"mapped" typologies of American suburban houses as well as the taste
that they constructed and were based on, and "Twenty-Six Gas Stations"
by Ed Ruscha as examples of the "sociological mapping...implicit in
some conceptual art" (185). More recently, and more ironically and
more internationally, there is Komar & Melamid's "The People's
Choice" ([http://www.diacenter.org/km/]{.underline}) which uses
official polling agencies to survey a nation's preferences in visual
art based on approximately ten preferences (ranging from "Favorite
color" to "Prefer indoor or outdoor scenes") and then realizes the
"most wanted painting" and "most unwanted painting" utilizing the
information. While this project is lightly politicized around issues
of taste and in its adaptation of the current political tendency to
base policies on poll results, it is linked to current site-specific
art practices which, as Kwon notes, "routinely engage the
collaborative participation of audience groups for the
conceptualization and production of the work...." From this
collaboration, these site-oriented works "are seen as a means to
strengthen art's capacity to penetrate the sociopolitical
organization of contemporary life with greater impact and meaning. In
this sense the possibilities to conceive of the site as something more
than place---as repressed ethnic history, a political cause, a
disenfranchised social group---is a crucial conceptual step in
redefining the public role of art and artists"(96). A recent
example---and there are many---of this laying bare of the historical
determinants of place is realized in Stan Douglas' Nu*tka* which
presents a "Canadian Gothic" of late-nineteenth century Nootka Sound
on the Northwest Coast of B.C. through interlacing video images of the
area and disembodied voices of the Spanish and English colonizers.

This chronotopic imagining of place as the site of a repressed racial
(ethnic, class and gendered) history has been an obvious project of
literature. In Canadian literature, this project was determined both
discursively and historically. Discursively, the embarrassingly narrow
yet dominant critical trope assigned to the national literature the
role of providing a history to a country strategically defined as
having none. This necessitated a "return of the repressed" in
literature to counter the dominant literary (national) historical
projects. Historically, Canada has imagined itself as bicultural and
this framework worked to suppress the histories of groups other than
the French and English. Within this very generalized framework,
official and aestheticized responses to this historical repression
have emerged. Small-town history chronicles that celebrate a town such
as **Morden in Manitoba**, which can be bought at City Hall (here in
Austria these projects are very similar and are called Heimatbuch
[roughly, "homeland book"]) or a book such as Andreas Schroeder's
**The Mennonites** which provides, in a coffeetable book format, a
history of the Mennonites in Canada. More well known, and with a
larger cultural impact, Joy Kogawa's novel **Obasan** brought forward
the history of the Japanese-Canadian internment. Yet the moment that
novelists are taken as historians is as problematic as when artists
are believed to be sociologists or social workers. For instance,
Michael Ondaatje's **In the Skin of a Lion** aestheticizes the
history of working-class people in Toronto, as if the workers
appreciated the modernist aesthetics of the worksite and the
solidarity of shared labor rather than complained about the relations
of production and wages.

That these textual and visual models present place and site as being a
manifestation of history can lead to a deflecting of the present. For
instance, Roy Miki speculates that **Obasan** could, from one vantage
point, "become an object of knowledge as a Canadianized text that
teaches us about racism in our past" (**Broken Entries** 143). The
implication is that racism is relegated, chronotopically, to the past.
Douglas' **Nu*tka***, in its return of repressed history, could
mimic the trope of First Nations' culture as a relic of the past, as
being only determined by European actions, as the passive site where
the history of dominant culture is acted out.

Here I want to speculate on (and politicize in a different way),
Kwon's idea of place as a "discursive vector" as a means to situate
oneself within a present site. I write "politicize" because it is
possible to propose a move from text to discourse as a movement from a
static structure open to analysis (whether virtuoso or standard) to a
constructing determinant of place and subjectivity. Here place/site
would not solely be determined by histories (dominant or repressed:
emergent or residual), but by competing constitutive discourses that
both affirm and erode the local/national and the everyday in the name
of the global. Without solely reducing globalization to the effect of
a discourse, it is possible to perhaps clarify the effects of
globalization by understanding them as being discursively enacted at
one level, as having a constitutive effect. Discursive is not
synonymous with "fluid," "ungrounded," as Kwon proposes, but is
precisely constitutive and grounding. In this formulation, the
particularisms of a place/site and its histories are not just the
oppositional force to globalization (or the corrective to dominant
historical narratives), but an aspect of place that can be utilized by
globalism; that is, a dialectic of local and global, or site and
nonsite (if a place is imagined as siteless in its loss of
particularities due to globalization).

My own turn toward the discursive effects of globalism in relation to
place/site arose because of the contradictions I saw in the city in
which I was living. The city of Calgary in Alberta imagines itself as
a regionally-based "open-for-business" kind of city, free of, but
also wary of, the ills of larger cities, yet a city of international
standards. This discourse of regionalism serves to cloak the existing
relations of production which Calgary---as an "oil town"---is linked
into, and determined by. Global capital through the multinational oil
and gas industry whose corporate logos hover above Calgary's gridded
streets is a key determinant of both the social relations of the city
and how the city imagines itself. When the oil industry is profitable
(due to high crude prices or a manufactured crisis), the city thrives
and new homes are built, rents rise, corporate headquarters shuffle,
cigar bars and fusion-cooking restaurants open---in short, a lot of
money is made by a few people but the scramble for profit is on. This
imaginary masking of real relations, a kind of cognitive masking, is
what Arjun Appadurai cites as fetishistic: "The locality (both in the
sense of the local factory or site of production and then extended
sense of the nation-state), becomes a fetish that disguises the
dispersed forces that actually drive the production process"
(**Modernity At Large**, 42). In Calgary, the global forces then have
a direct effect on the planning and layout of the city, as well as the
architecture; the social space of the city (itself a constituting
aspect), is determined by the management of the effects of
globalization and localization. Seeing how the effective discourses of
place/region and nation could serve as a mystifying factor, blocking
the real relations of the city, I moved away from an investigation of
place and toward the discursive determination of a place/site.

As a writer, the emphasis on the constitutive discourses of site/place
can supplement site as repressed histories. These discourses must also
be seen, alongside repressed histories, as historical developments, as
constitutive elements of the repressed history and emergent history.
The site of writing then becomes imagined as a place of intersecting
discourses: not groundless and fluid but both determined and
determining.



# Robert Glück: Long Note on New Narrative





**To talk about** the beginnings of New Narrative, I have to talk about my
friendship with Bruce Boone. We met in the early seventies through the
San Francisco Art Institute's bulletin board: Ed and I wanted to move
and Bruce and Burton wanted to move---would we all be happy living
together? For some reason both couples dropped the idea and remained
in our respective flats for many years. But Bruce and I were poets and
our obsession with Frank O'Hara forged a bond.

I was twenty-three or twenty-four. Bruce was seven years older. He was
a wonderful teacher. He read to transform himself and to attain a
correct understanding. Such understanding was urgently political.

Bruce had his eye on the catastrophic future, an upheaval he predicted
with a certain grandeur, but it was my own present he helped me find.
I read and wrote to invoke what seemed impossible--relation
itself--in order to take part in a world that ceaselessly makes
itself up, to "wake up" to the world, to recognize the world, to be
convinced that the world exists, to take revenge on the world for not
existing.

To talk about New Narrative, I also have to talk about Language
Poetry, which was in its heroic period in the seventies. I treat
diverse poets as one unit, a sort of flying wedge, because that's how
we experienced them. It would be hard to overestimate the drama they
brought to a Bay Area scene that limped through the seventies, with
the powerful exception of feminist poets like Judy Grahn, and the
excitement generated by movement poetry. Language Poetry's Puritan
rigor, delight in technical vocabularies, and professionalism were new
to a generation of Bay Area poets whose influences included the Beats,
Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer, the New York School (Bolinas was its
western outpost), surrealism and psychedelic surrealism.

Suddenly people took sides, though at times these confrontations
resembled a pastiche of the embattled positions of earlier
avant-guards. Language Poetry seemed very "straight male"---though
what didn't? Barrett Watten's **Total Syntax**, for example,
brilliantly established (as it dispatched) a lineage of fathers:
Olson, Zukofsky, Pound, etc.

If I could have become a Language poet I would have; I craved the
formalist fireworks, a purity that invented its own tenets. On the
snowy mountain-top of progressive formalism, from the highest high
road of modernist achievement, there was plenty of contempt heaped on
less rigorous endeavor. I had come to a dead end in the mid-seventies
like the poetry scene itself. The problem was not theoretical---or it
was: I could not go on until I figured out some way to understand
where I was. I also craved the community the Language Poets made for
themselves.

The questions vexing Bruce and me and the kind of rigor we needed were
only partly addressed by Language Poetry which, in the most general
sense, we saw as an aesthetics built on an examination (by
subtraction: of voice, of continuity) of the ways language generates
meaning. The same could be said of other experimental work, especially
the minimalisms, but Language Poetry was our proximate example.

Warring camps and battle lines drawn between representation and
non-representation---retrospection makes the argument seem as
arbitrary as Fancy vs. Imagination. But certainly the "logic of
history" at that moment supported the idea of this division, along
with the struggle to find a third position that would encompass the
whole argument.

I experienced the poetry of disjunction as a luxurious idealism in
which the speaking subject rejects the confines of representation and
disappears in the largest freedom, that of language itself. My
attraction to this freedom and to the professionalism with which it
was purveyed made for a kind of class struggle within myself. Whole
areas of my experience, especially gay experience, were not admitted
to this utopia, partly because the mainstream reflected a resoundingly
coherent image of myself back to me---an image so unjust that it
amounted to a tyranny that I could not turn my back on. We had been
disastrously described by the mainstream---a naming whose most extreme
(though not uncommon) expression was physical violence. Political
agency involved at least a provisionally stable identity.

Meanwhile, gay identity was also in its heroic period---it had not yet
settled into just another nationalism and it was new enough to know
its own constructedness. In the urban mix, some great experiment was
actually taking place, a genuine community where strangers and
different classes and ethnicities rubbed more than shoulders. This
community was not destroyed by commodity culture, which was destroying
so many other communities; instead, it was founded in commodity
culture. We had to talk about it. Bruce and I turned to each other to
see if we could come up with a better representation---not in order to
satisfy movement pieties or to be political, but in order to be. We
(eventually we were gay, lesbian, and working class writers) could not
let narration go.

Since I'm confined to hindsight, I write as though Bruce and I were
following a plan instead of stumbling and groping toward a writing
that could join other literatures of the present. We could have found
narrative models in, say, Clark Coolidge's prose, so perhaps
narrative practice relates outward to the actual community whose story
is being told. We could have located self-reference and awareness of
artifice in, say, the novels of Ronald Firbank, but we didn't. So
again, our use of language that knows itself relates outward to a
community speaking to itself dissonantly.

We were fellow travelers of Language Poetry and the innovative
feminist poetry of that time, but our lives and reading lead us toward
a hybrid aesthetic, something impure. We (say, Bruce Boone, Camille
Roy, Kevin Killian, Dodie Bellamy, Mike Amnasan, myself and, to
include the dead, Steve Abbott and Sam D'Allesandro) are still fellow
travelers of the poetries that evolved since the early eighties, when
writers talked about "nonnarrative." One could untangle that knot
forever, or build an aesthetics on the ways language conveys silence,
chaos, undifferentiated existence, and erects countless horizons of
meaning.

How to be a theory-based writer?---one question. How to represent my
experience as a gay man?---another question just as pressing. These
questions lead to readers and communities almost completely ignorant
of each other. Too fragmented for a gay audience? Too much sex and
"voice" for a literary audience? I embodied these incommensurates so
I had to ask this question: How can I convey urgent social meanings
while opening or subverting the possibilities of meaning itself? That
question has deviled and vexed Bay Area writing for twenty-five years.
What kind of representation least deforms its subject? Can language be
aware of itself (as object, as system, as commodity, as abstraction)
yet take part in the forces that generate the present? Where in
writing does engagement become authentic? One response, the politics
of form, apparently does not answer the question completely.

One afternoon in 1976, Bruce remarked on the questions to the reader
I'd been throwing into poems and stories. They were self-consciously
theatrical and they seemed to him to pressure and even sometimes to
reverse the positions of reader and writer. Reader/writer dynamics
seemed like a way into the problems that preoccupied us, a toe in the
water!

From our poems and stories, Bruce abstracted text-metatext: a story
keeps a running commentary on itself from the present. The commentary,
taking the form of a meditation or a second story, supplies a
succession of frames. That is, the more you fragment a story, the more
it becomes an example of narration itself--narration displaying its
devices--while at the same time (as I wrote in 1981) the metatext
"asks questions, asks for critical response, makes claims on the
reader, elicits comments. In any case, text-metatext takes its form
from the dialectical cleft between real life and life as it wants to
be."[^1_gluck_1]

We did not want to break the back of representation or to "punish"
it for lying, but to elaborate narration on as many different planes
as we could, which seemed consistent with the lives we lead. Writing
can't will away power relations and commodity life; instead, writing
must accept its relation to power and recognize that at present group
practice resides inside the commodity. Bruce wrote, "When evaluating
image in American culture, isn't it a commodity whether anyone likes
it or not? You make your additions and subtractions from that point
on."[^1_gluck_2]

In 1978, Bruce and I launched the Black Star Series and published my
**Family Poems** and his **My Walk With Bob**, a lovely book.[^1_gluck_3] In
"Remarks on Narrative"---the afterword of **Family Poems**---Bruce
wrote, "As has now been apparent for some time, the poetry of the
'70s seems generally to have reached a point of stagnation,
increasing a kind of refinement of technique and available forms,
without yet being able to profit greatly from the vigor, energy and
accessibility that mark so much of the new Movement writing of gays,
women and Third World writers, among others. Ultimately this impasse
of poetry reflects conditions in society itself."[^1_gluck_4]

We appreciated the comedy of mounting an offensive ("A critique of
the new trends toward conceptualization, linguistic abstraction and
process poetry") with those slenderest volumes. My poems and stories
were set "in the family," not so antipsychological as they might
have been given that we assumed any blow to interiority was a step
forward for mankind.

We contended with the Language Poets while seeking their attention in
the forums they erected for themselves. We published articles in
**Poetics Journal** and **L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E**, and spoke in talk series
and forums---a mere trickle in the torrent of their critical work. If
Language Poetry was a dead end, what a fertile dead end it was!

New Narrative was in place by the time **Elements of a Coffee
Service** was published by Donald Allen's Four Season's Foundation
in 1982, and Hoddypole published Bruce's novel, **Century of Clouds**
in 1980. We were thinking about autobiography; by autobiography we
meant daydreams, nightdreams, the act of writing, the relationship to
the reader, the meeting of flesh and culture, the self as
collaboration, the self as disintegration, the gaps, inconsistences
and distortions, the enjambments of power, family, history and
language.

Bruce and I brought high and low together between the covers of a
book, mingling essay, lyric, and story. Our publishing reflected those
different modes: stories from **Elements** appeared in gay
anthologies, porn magazines, **Social Text**, and **Soup**. Bruce
wrote about Georges Bataille for **The Advocate***.
*
I wanted to write with a total continuity and total disjunction since
I experienced the world (and myself) as continuous and infinity
divided. That was my ambition for writing. Why should a work of
literature be organized by one pattern of engagement? Why should a
"position" be maintained regarding the size of the gaps between
units of meaning? To describe how the world is organized may be the
same as organizing the world. I wanted the pleasures and politics of
the fragment and the pleasures and politics of story, gossip, fable
and case history; the randomness of chance and a sense of
inevitability; sincerity while using appropriation and pastiche. When
Barrett Watten said about **Jack the Modernist**, "You have your cake
and eat it too," I took it as a great compliment, as if my intention
spoke through the book.

During the seventies, Bruce was working on his doctorate at UC
Berkeley. His dissertation was a structuralist and gay reading of
O'Hara, that is, O'Hara and community, a version of which was
published in the first issue of **Social Text** in 1979. He joined the
Marxism and Theory Group at St. Cloud which gave birth to that
journal. Bruce also wrote critical articles (especially tracking the
"gay band" of the Berkeley Renaissance).([^1_gluck_4]) Bruce introduced me to
most of the critics who would make a foundation for New Narrative
writing.


Here are a few of them:

Georg Lukacs: In **The Theory of the Novel**, Lukacs maintains that
the novel contains---that is, holds together---incommensurates. The
epic and novel are the community telling itself its story, a story
whose integration becomes increasingly hard to achieve. **The Theory
of the Novel** leads to ideas of collaboration and community that are
not naive, that is, to narrative that questions itself. It
redistributes relations of power and springs the writer from the box
of psychology, since he becomes the community speaking to itself. I
wrote "Caricature," a talk given at 80 Langton in 1983, mostly using
Lukacs' book, locating instances of conservative and progressive
communities speaking to themselves: "If the community is a given, so
are its types."

Louis Althusser: His essay, "Ideological State Apparatuses,"
refigures the concept of base/superstructure. Terry Eagleton rang the
following change on Althusser's bulky formula: Ideology is the
imaginary resolution of real contradictions. By 1980, literary
naturalism was easily deprived of its transparency, but this formula
also deprives all fantasy of transparency, including the fantasy of
personality. If making a personality is not different from making a
book, in both cases one could favor the "real contradictions" side
of the formula. If personality is a fiction (a political fiction!)
then it is a story in common with other stories---it occurs on the
same plane of experience. This "formula" sets those opacities---a
novel, a personality---as equals on the stage of history, and supports
a new version of autobiography in which "fact" and "fiction"
inter-penetrate.

Althusser comes with a lot of baggage. For example, he divided science
from ideology, and ideology from theory. Frankly, Bruce and I pillaged
critical theory for concepts that gave us access to our experience. In
retrospect, it might be better simply to "go with" cultural studies.
To the endless chain of equal cultural manifestations (a song by REM,
the Diet of Worms, Rousseau's **Confessions**), we add another equal
sign, attaching the self as yet another thing the culture "dreamed
up."

Georges Bataille: Bataille was central to our project. He finds a
counter-economy of rupture and excess that includes art, sex, war,
religious sacrifice, sports events, ruptured subjectivity, the
dissolution of bodily integuments---"expenditure" of all kinds.
Bataille showed us how a bath house and a church could fulfill the
same function in their respective communities.

In writing about sex, desire and the body, New Narrative approached
performance art, where self is put at risk by naming names, becoming
naked, making the irreversible happen---the book becomes social
practice that is lived. The theme of obsessive romance did double
duty, de-stabling the self and asserting gay experience. Steve Abbott
wrote, "Gay writers Bruce Boone and Robert Glück (like Acker, Dennis
Cooper or the subway graffitists again) up the ante on this factuality
by weaving their own names, and those of friends and lovers, into
their work. The writer/artist becomes exposed and vulnerable: you risk
being foolish, mean-spirited, wrong. But if the writer's life is more
open to judgement and speculation, so is the reader's." ([^1_gluck_6])

Did we believe in the "truth and freedom" of sex? Certainly we were
attracted to scandal and shame, where there is so much information. I
wanted to write close to the body---the place language goes
reluctantly. We used porn, where information saturates narrative, to
expose and manipulate genre's formulas and dramatis personae, to
arrive at ecstacy and loss of narration as the self sheds its social
identities. We wanted to speak about subject/master and object/slave.
Bataille showed us that loss of self and attainment of nothingness is
a group activity. He supplied the essential negative, a zero planted
in the midst of community. His concept of transgression gave us lots
of fuel, as did his novels of philosophic pornography.

Now I'd add that transgressive writing is not necessarily about sex
or the body---or about anything one can predict. There's no manual;
transgressive writing shocks by articulating the present, the one
thing impossible to put into words, because a language does not yet
exist to describe the present. Bruce translated Bataille's **Guilty**
for Lapis Press when I worked as an editor there. We hammered out the
manuscript together, absorbing Bataille gesturally.

Five more critics. Walter Benjamin: for lyrical melancholy (which
reads as autobiography) and for permission to mix high and low. V.N.
Voloshinov: for discovering that meaning resides within its social
situation, and that contending powers struggle within language itself.
Rolland Barthes: for a style that goes back to autobiography, for the
fragment, and for displaying the constructed nature of
story---"baring the device." Michel Foucault: for the constructed
nature of sexuality, the self as collaboration, and the
not-to-be-underestimated example of an out gay critic. (Once at 18th
and Castro, Michel pierced Bruce with his eagle gaze and Bruce was
overcome!---he says.) Julia Kristeva: for elaborating the meaning of
abjection in **Powers of Horror**.

Our interest in Dennis Cooper and Kathy Acker produced allegiances and
friendships with those writers. Kathy moved to San Francisco in the
fall of 1981; while getting settled she stayed with Denise Kastan, who
lived downstairs from me. Denise and I co-directed Small Press
Traffic. Kathy was at work on **Great Expectations**. In fact, Denise
and I appear in it; we are the whores Danella and Barbraella. Kathy's
writing gave Bruce, Steve Abbott and myself another model, evolved far
beyond our own efforts, for the interrogation of autobiography as
"text" perpetually subverted by another text. Appropriation puts in
question the place of the writer---in fact, it turns the writer into a
reader.

Meanwhile, Bruce and I were thinking about the painters who were
rediscovering the figure, like Eric Fischl and Julian Schnabel. They
found a figuration that had passed through the flame of abstract
expressionism and the subsequent isms, operating through them. It made
us feel we were part of a crosscultural impulse rather than a local
subset. Bruce wrote, "With much gay writing and some punk notoriously
(Acker the big example), the sexual roots of aggression come into
question. There's a scream of connection, the figure that emerges
ghostly: life attributed to those who have gone beyond. So in Dennis
Cooper's **Safe** there's a feeling-tone like a Schnabel
painting:the ground's these fragments of some past, the stag, the
Roman column, whatever---on them a figure that doesn't quite exist
but would maybe like to. The person/persona/thing the writer's trying
to construct from images---"([^1_gluck_7])

In 1976, I started volunteering in the non-profit bookstore Small
Press Traffic and became co-director not long after. From 1977 to
1985, I ran a reading series and held free walk-in writing workshops
at the store. The workshops became a kind of New Narrative laboratory
attended by Michael Amnasan, Steve Abbott, Sam D'Allesandro, Kevin
Killian, Dodie Bellamy, Camille Roy, and many other writers whose
works extend my own horizon. I would start by reading some piece of
writing that interested me: Chaucer, Robert Smithson, Lydia Davis,
Ivan Bunin, Jim Thompson, a book of London street games, Thomas Wyatt,
Sei Shonagon. We were aspiring to an ideal of learning derived as much
from Spicer and Duncan as from our contemporaries.

Most writers we knew were reading theory. Later, guided by Bruce, we
started a left reading group at Small Press Traffic, attended by Steve
Benson, Ron Silliman, Denise Kastan, Steve Abbott, Bruce, myself and
others. The personal demolished the political, and after a few months
we disbanded. From that era I recall Ron's epithet (which Bruce and I
thought delicious) *The Small Press Traffic School of Dissimulation*.

More successful was the Left/Write Conference we mounted in 1981 at
the Noe Valley Ministry. The idea for a conference was conceived in
the spring of 1998 by Bruce and Steve Abbott, who sent letters to
thirty writers of various ethnicities and aesthetic positions. Steve
was a tireless community builder, and Left/Write was an expression of
New Narrative's desire to bring communities together, a desire which
informed the reading series at Small Press Traffic, Steve Abbott's
**Soup** (where the term New Narrative first appeared), Michael
Amnasan's **Ottotole**, Camille Roy and Nayland Blake's **Dear
World**, Kevin Killian and Brian Monte's **No Apologies**, and later
Kevin and Dodie Bellamy's **Mirage**. We felt urgent about it,
perhaps because we each belonged to such disparate groups. To our
astonishment, three hundred people attended Left/Write, so we
accomplished on a civic stage what we were attempting in our writing,
editing and curating: to mix groups and modes of discourse. Writers
famous inside their own group and hardly known outside, like Judy
Grahn and Erica Hunt, spoke and read together for the first time.

Out of that conference the Left Writers Union emerged; soon it was
commandeered by its most unreconstructed faction which prioritized gay
and feminist issues out of existence. At one meeting, we were
instructed to hold readings in storefronts on ground level so the
"masses of San Francisco" could walk in!

During this decade--1975-1985--Bruce and I carried on what amounted
to one long gabby phone conversation. We brought gossip and anecdote
to our writing because they contain speaker and audience, establish
the parameters of community and trumpet their"unfair" points of
view. I hardly ever "made things up," a plot still seems exotic, but
as a collagist I had an infinite field. I could use the lives we
endlessly described to each other as "found material" which
complicates storytelling because the material also exists on the same
plane as the reader's life. Found materials have a kind of radiance,
the truth of the already-known.

In 1981 we published **La Fontaine** ** as a valentine to our
friendship. In one poem, Bruce (and Montaigne!) wrote, "In the
friendship whereof I speak...our souls mingle and blend in a fusion
so complete that the seam that joins them disappears and is found no
more. If pressed to say why I loved him I'd reply, because it was
him, because it was me."([^1_gluck_9])

In using the tag New Narrative, I concede there is such a thing. In
the past I was reluctant to promote a literary school that endured
even ten minutes, much less a few years. Bruce and I took the notion
of a "school" half seriously, and once New Narrative began to
resemble a program, we abandoned it, declining to recognize ourselves
in the tyrants and functionaries that make a literary school. Or was
it just a failure of nerve? Now I am glad to see the term used by
younger writers in San Francisco, writers in other cities, like Gail
Scott in Montreal, and critics like Earl Jackson, Jr., Antony
Easthope, Carolyn Dinshaw, and Dianne Chisholm. Bruce and I may have
been kidding about founding a school, but we were serious about
wanting to bring emotion and subject matter into the field of
innovative writing. I hope that these thoughts on our project---call
it what you will---are useful to those looking for ways to extending
the possibilities of poem and story without backtracking into the
mainstream, or into 19th-century transparency.

# Rob Halpern: Notes Toward (Es)saying "I", Narratively






> I was already being prepared for [the world's] tournaments by a
> training
> which taught me to have a horror of faulty grammar instead of
> teaching me,
> when I committed these faults, not to envy others who avoided them.
>
>              --Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo


**Once upon a time** is always here. Crisis, my origin: this fault.
Someone is called where I am compelled to explain. To make narrative
critically: this response to crisis. Otherwise it's narrative by
default simply because there is no other way actively to be here.

 

**From the Sanskrit root** *gna*, or know, our word narrative derives
bound to practice. In Latin, the root meaning appears to have doubled,
manifesting an otherwise latent critical difference. There is at once
*(g)narus*: knowing, expert, skillful; and *narro*: to relate or tell.
([^1_halpern_1]) A fault---mine, and ours---runs thru the space between. *Fault*:
deficiency, lack, scarcity; as well as slip, error, mistake. Also,
more critically: *fault* as dislocation or a break in continuity of
the strata or vein. *Here*, knowing is held in suspense and knowledge
is always potential. The process of telling/relating needn't connive
with already determined knowledge; narrative might, for example,
radically deviate, turning away from, or perverting, the very practice
of authorization, questioning rather than securing the position of the
one who tells. Here, between the overdetermined and the indeterminate,
*narrative determines*, that is, it constrains and enables, just as it
struggles and responds, testing the tension between knowing and
composing. *Here, we make our narratives ourselves, but, in the first
place, under very definite assumptions and conditions.* ([^1_halpern_2])




## I. Poetically


**At once wayless and wayward**, I positions a self *here* at the site
of narrative beginnings: place of mutability, place of many turns. The
crossroads of legend where every way is lost and every way is open.
Site of impossible possibility and paradox, where extremes coincide.
At once *here*: where aversion keeps one in place---*I: this paralyzed
fixture*---disinclined to turn another way; and *here*: away from
which every turn is perversion, an aberrant way away from the proper.
*Here* is forever shifting, the site of all potential, site of
suspense: where *aporia* (knowing no way, having no word, possessing
no resource) and *euporia* (knowing so many ways, having everything to
say, possessing it all in abundance) converge. Here is where I
intervenes in its own story, the permeable interface of averse
states---for example: impoverishment and abundance---as if with *two
faces averse, and conjoined*. In the space between states I spreads,
this narrative surface: at once this promise of disruption, this
promise of continuity.


**Crisis** is the point at which old orders no longer cohere and
*here* looms suddenly bereft of foundation. Here, for example, is
where Socrates steers his interlocutor: toward *aporia*-place of lost
ways. But what if this crisis could be experienced *euporically*, as a
moment of possibility precisely here where a way appears impossible.
Here occasions the paradoxical coincidence of antithetical terms. Not
the paralyzing absence of a way but the accessibility of always other
ways. Not naively, not as if everything and anything were possible,
but realistically, as if the site of narrative were the only place
where the impossible might open onto possibility.


*Here*: wayless, I is exposed; and *here*, wayward, I resists. It
seems so familiar: experiencing the simultaneity of political
possibility and impossibility. The fullness of the imagination
paradoxically constrained and enabled by a politically invested
environment which threatens to render that fullness innocuous if not
impotent. How to breathe this air that animates such cynicism, how to
live in this element that triumphantly promotes irony as the "task of
the day". Somewhere between the pessimistic and the utopian, where
these extremes coincide, where pessimism reveals its utopian bent:
here, one might ask how to think the moment when "nothing is
possible" becomes "only the impossible is possible". And here
another realism takes the world for its measure and referent: here,
where the limits of history, the bleak horizon that pens us in, meet
the pressures of the imagination.


**Discrete identities and sovereign subjects**---like the kings and
saints of history---are what they are by virtue of narrative strength.
But I am more interested in narrative frailty, narrative faults:
proxies and prostheses, artificial extensions, these interventions in
the world. Rather than narratives saturated with ends known in advance
of every beginning, I am interested in narratives that destabilize the
coherence of the I which, like a promissory note or stand-in for some
future fulfillment, suffers this contractual obligation to
self-identify over time. The self-same I, untroubled by difference,
might fill the space between disruption and continuity, but it cannot
fulfil it. The self-same I: at once the coherent *effect* of narrative
and the grammatical position to which one recursively returns to
ensure that coherence and whereby narrative possibility is filtered or
censored to preserve an ideal of intelligibility. Coherence, here, is
but the accomplishment of an optimal performance, a labored production
of social and linguistic grammars the faults of which are seamlessly
concealed *so as no appearance of any wound or hurt outwardly might be
at once perceived*. But there are other possible effects, other ways,
veering toward away or versing waywardly. What if, for example, we
were able to avow I's fictitiousness without and affirm our
necessary, if only provisional, belief in it. Here, rather than
persuading, narrative might perform its agnostic potential: the
promise of possible impossibilities that holds sway in the ambiguous
space between. This refusal of certainty, this averse turn away from
knowledge, this perverse turn toward knowing: this is not a
declaration of incoherence. Between impoverishment and abundance
(where impoverishment becomes itself a figure for abundance) the I
traverses narrative orders---disrupting and maintaining---while it is
simultaneously traversed by them.


**I goes between: a love story.** In Plato's *Symposium*, Diotima
locates Love in the space between ignorance and wisdom. Offspring of
Poros (way, resource, expedient) and Penia (wayless, poverty, lack.)
Love paradoxically embodies this antinomy and cannot give a reason for
itself. According to Diotima, Love judges *without being able to give
proper reasons*. "It is judging things correctly without being able
to give a reason," says Diotima, "surely, you see that this is not
the same as knowledge, for how can knowledge be devoid of reason?"
Jacques Lacan derives from this---in however faulty a way---one of his
characteristic figures for love: giving that which one does not have
to give. I am thinking of narrative like Love: wayless and wayward,
determined to do precisely what it cannot do. Its reasons are but
ruses. Between *aporia* and *euporia* Love is risked agnostically,
like a narrative that risks its own foundation. Sentenced and
committed, here, I goes between, exposed to every possibility of
rejection and loss, abjection and shame.


**Augustine and Stein:** Someone is called where I is compelled to
explain. "Well well is he. Explain my doubts, well well is he explain
my doubts.": this is how Gertrude Stein begins "Regularly Regularly
In Narrative" in **How to Write**. But the work narrative is called
upon to perform ("Explain my doubts") is alien to the work narrative
will ultimately do. Explain my doubts: at once the intended imperative
and the impossible end. My doubts will never be properly explained, my
uncertainty never properly reasoned away. Explanation fills the space
between ignorance and knowledge, but it cannot fulfil it. Recalling
another essay of Stein's, explanation is composition while
composition itself is figured as this "beginning again and again and
again explaining composition and time." And taking the perverse turn
toward the threshold of early modernity, there is Saint Augustine
determined to found the authority necessary to begin a book whose very
goal it is to authorize its subject. He, too, is concerned with
beginning, explanation and time about which he writes in the
**Confessions**: "If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it
to someone who asks me, I don't know." Between faith and doubt, past
and future, knowing and not-knowing, between 'he' (the partial
referent to which past experience is attached; it interferes with and
informs writing's present) and 'you' (a total referent---my
audience, my God, the other I love---to which "something more" that
escapes representation is attached and toward which narrative tends)
between all these faulty binarisms Augustine navigates a way to forge
an 'I': the vehicle and the effect of an other faith. Explain my
doubts: the self-imposed imperative to narrate, to compose a self. A
crisis in knowing runs thru composing just as narrative traces the
fault along which I becomes to articulate or align itself with the
world *in ways*. In the long afternoon shadows thrown by the likes of
Augustine and Stein, I am drawn to this, the faultiness of narrative,
its promise.


### To I this plot

>           --Saint Augustine



The problem of beginning, the order of calling and knowing, is a
perennial preoccupation of both narrative and history. In our
postmodern era in which history has illusorily evanesced, narrative
promises at once to rescue the I from an indifferent individualism and
to turn the present away from indifference. Augustine's double bind
is here: in order to gain knowledge and understanding, one must call
or praise; but without knowledge and understanding one cannot know who
or what it is one calls. Mistaken audience is tantamount to mistaken
identity. Who is listening. Who is out there. Here, along the fault
that runs between audience and identity, narrative and history
continue to produce each other. Here, an I is "emplotted." Here,
Augustine's address, his "how am I able to speak to you?." the
fragility of its beginning, awakens him to the danger of being
dispossessed of precisely that to which his I professes to cling:
communicative possibility. But who is the subject of that possibility
if the I who depends on past experience for recognition is displaced,
transfigured by the new experience of narrating a conversion: the
advent of an other I? I is this essay, this attempt, this fragment,
this experiment---like composition is explanation---this reach
transversing the pronominal distance between "Explain my doubts,
well, well is he explain my doubts" and "how am I to speak to you?."
In reaching out, I, discomfitted, doubles over the hinge of this plot
and risks a world. Between belief and doubt, this communication
without guarantees: the very condition of narrative possibility.


### A crisis of audience

>             --Gertrude Stein




Bewildered by the question of containment, uncertain exactly which way
to turn, Augustine's move in relation to his audience is paradoxical.
Turning toward what "there is in me" he intimates, indeed creates,
the depth of a private self. Simultaneously he turns toward "heaven
and earth" revealing the self's dependence on exteriority. But is
there an essential difference between the two dimensions? Must one
*aversion*---one turn away---achieve priority over and above the
another turn? Or might a mutable perversion---a turning aside from
truth or right, a diversion to improper use, a recognition of
necessary distortion, error, fault---intervene thus making coextensive
interior and exterior? Privative and excessive, I becomes this
permeable surface, this interface of in and out: this narrative
tension between self and other. Paradoxically, for Augustine, only a
turn away from the destabilizing question of audience, in other words,
only silence or not-writing, can ensure his possession of a self
untroubled by spatial location; only a turn away from either way will
ensure comfort and allow him to remain confident in the knowledge of
such a self *without knowing it at all*. Self-knowledge as stasis
annuls self-knowing as narrative process. The very fact of
Augustine's writing is testament to his recognition that aversion can
offer no way; it cannot ensure a truthful I, only a proper self, that
is, a property which must risk itself in the act of narrating a story
of origins, a return to the fault. As soon as one begins to narrate
oneself, one is adrift, exposed to the hazard of contingency and
doubt, relatively unmoored but bound to the world nevertheless. In the
face of political danger, I mobilizes narratively: hazard becomes
promise as I perverts a way away from established norms. Looking back
I still obeys, only paradoxically. *Here* crisis troubles the ground
on which Augustine is authorized to speak as "himself." Every word of
address threatens to expose the subject to the vertigo that looms when
the secure ground of "self-knowledge" gives way to groundlessness.
And *here* it is precisely the move to explain my doubts, to provide
for them a foundation, that makes foundation impossible. Truthful I's
are improper selves, selves held in suspense, in potential and *in
situ* in the space between. In the **Confessions**, this abyss, as it
opens onto narrative possibility, becomes paradoxically the very
ground of love and faith.

Around every one of I's articulations, a story begins to congeal, a
plot thickens. Once upon a time, I stands in for this memory of the
present, a lapidary effect of all the stories I've ever told. Here is
where I unbecomes along this fault in the world, this cleavage or
interruption that opens onto narrative in the discomfiting space
between where I never fits. Here is where I encounters oblivion and
possibility simultaneously on the threshold of another sentence,
another scene, another world. "It was at the threshold of a world
such as this that I stood in peril as a boy" [Augustine]. But it is
not, as in Augustine, "my past foulness and carnal corruption of my
soul" that defines the narrative fault; rather the I itself---the
risk and the promise.


### "Something more"


> Do heaven and earth, then, contain the whole of you, since you fill
> them? Or, when once you have filled them, is some part of you left
> over because they are too small to hold you? If this is so, when you
> have filled heaven and earth, does that part of you which remains
> flow over into some other place?
>
>             --Augustine




*That part of you which remains* cannot be represented, cannot be
assimilated to any way. You---audience, condition and limit of my
self---an unrepresentable horizon coincidently inside and out of me.
"For without you, what am I to myself but the leader of my own
destruction?" [Augustine]. Or, as Sandra Bernhardt titles her film:
**Without You I'm Nothing**. Her self composed thru an appeal to the
other. Turning toward 'you.' toward the invitation to explain, I
becomes, thru narration, *in relation to*. Relation alone saves one
from destruction while paradoxically establishing the bond between
'you' and 'I' which erotically threatens I's preservation as a
discrete and coherent self. Narrative's prosthetic origin: this
other, who both is and is not I. *You may* be I's determining "last
instance"---an absolute referent modulated thru innumerable social
circumstances that determines 'I' in the final analysis. You, an
Archimedean point doubled and reflecting two horizons, in and out,
creating this field of apparent depth in the space between. You is
equidistant from and coincident with I's every utterance. In relation
to you, I's meanings are measured. Thus is I realistic without being
real. Risking nothing short of love, the voice aims at "a particular
absolute... it aims beyond particular objects to that 'something
more' that exceeds them." ([^1_halpern_3]) That part of you that always remains.


## II. Politically


**Narrative as counter-statement**. What is the difference between
being called to state (called to call a thing by its proper name) and
being called to *the* state (called to recognize one's place within
the established order of things)? I ask this with the belief that
narrative has everything to offer the effort that would resist these
imperatives, enabling responses to always other calls. Called to state
and called to *the* state: names, like bodies, are assimilated to
established narrative orders. But narrative needn't accede to the
status of statement, or doxa: rather, it is narrative as
counter-statement, as paradox, that enables one to refuse stately
calls.


**Edward II, a digression.** The story of the English king Edward the
Second. In the sixteenth century, Holinshed, the popular chronicler or
historical narrator to whom both Marlowe and Shakespeare turned for
material, tells us that King Edward "began to hold the nobles in no
regard, to set nothing by their instructions, and to take small heed
unto the good government of the commonwealth, so that within a while,
he gave himself to wantonness, passing time in voluptuous pleasure,
and riotess excess: and to help them forward that kind of life, the
foresaid Peers who (as it may be thought, he had sworne to make the
king *to forget himself, and the state to which he was called* [my
italics]) furnished the court with jesters, ruffians, flattering
parasites, musicians and other vile and naughtie ribalds, that the
king might spend both days and nights in jesting, playing, blanketing
and in such other filthy and dishonourable excercises." [Chronicles
of England, Scotland and Ireland, 1587]. "The foresaid Peers" is
none other than Gaveston, the king's minion to whom Christopher
Marlowe has the Edward of his drama implore, "Knowest thou not who I
am? Thy friend, thy self, another Gaveston." To forget oneself and to
forget the state to which one is called are virtually synonymous
offenses that render Edward a 'bad subject' rather than a good
sovereign. They are capital crimes serious enough to land Edward in
the tower, where he is sodomized to death with a red hot iron spit. As
Holinshed reports, the method was chosen "so as no appearance of any
wound or hurt outwardlie might be at once perceived." Death appears
woundlessly so that Edward can appear in state. Were this wound to
surface it would assume the figural status of a counter-statement.
Here, between life and death, continuity and discontinuity; here,
around this sign of struggle, a different narrative would take shape
paradoxically, this intervention in the orders of state. Thus would
the wound's articulation make it all "connectedly different."

From Augustine to Stein, narration has provided the way for
re-articulating the world in the space between, a space inassimilable
to already established orders, a space where discontinuity and
continuity together define a fault "outwardly." But what about
politics? What about poetry? And what about the division of
intellectual labor that traditionally separates the two? Marx's
**Eighteenth Brumaire** is often cited in this regard: "The social
revolution of the nineteenth century cannot draw its poetry from the
past, but only from the future." But what if the inquiry into the
relation between narrative and "social revolution" were to focus on
neither past nor future but rather on this space between? Right now, I
am reading Stein's **Narration** beside Louis Althusser's essay on
"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses". "The tenacious
obviousness of the point of view of production alone, or even that of
mere productive practice are so integrated into our everyday
'consciousness' that it is extremely hard, not to say almost
impossible, to raise oneself to the point of view of reproduction."
[Althusser]. In Stein's text, the question appears as follows:
"Can anyone separate themselves from the land so they can see it?"
And, as if in response to both questions, she writes "I am so certain
so more than certain that it ought to be done. I know so well all the
causes why it cannot be done and yet if it cannot be done cannot it be
done it would be so very much more interesting than anything if it
could be done even if it cannot be done." What is to be done is
precisely what cannot be done. Nevertheless, the imperative is
sustained: to recognize the unrecognizable, to do the undoable. Here,
the narrative imperative, like a Luddite wrench in the machinery of
state, would prevent the apparatus from reproducing itself. "To make
a thing a thing that they recognize while they are writing make it
something that had no existing before that writing gave it that
recognition, they tried to do this by changing something" [Stein].
This must be done. The point of view of reproduction is the point of
view of an antinomy defined by the apparent impossibility of doing
mutually exclusive things, like continuing and discontinuing,
localizing and sublimating. "Revolution" is a narrative not at all
unlike the narrative of conversion and it too is defined by paradox
according to which continuity with past experience must be maintained
in order to compose a discontinuous way *here*. Stein might be
discoursing on ideology and Althusser, at great pains to demonstrate
how Marx succeeded precisely "by changing something." might be
writing about narration. And while it is dangerous to reduce politics
to literary theory---and this is not at all my intent---it is critical
to ask whether any such success at making it "connectedly different"
is conceivable without narrative? To make it all otherwise: a
deceptively simple imperative. To find one's way
maplessly---aporically and euporically---along the fault. To essay the
unthinkable, to attempt to do it all by other means: that is to
practice narrative "as a socially symbolic act." Fredric Jameson
articulates this as a dialectical imperative: "To reckon one's own
position as an observer into the critical thinking in process...one
[then] no longer has to posit an end to history in order for
historical thought to take place." [**Marxism and Form**].


**Ideology *is* a narrative practice**. Narrative situates us
historically in the world. Once upon a time opens onto this critical
scene of telling and distributes an historical *here* equally thru the
space of narration. The scene is primal in the sense that it is
domestic; it frames a world within the world while promising a way to
encounter the frame. Narrative is also the vehicle of ideology: it
represents (in Althusser's formulation) one's imagined relations to
real conditions of existence; it is charged with the demands of
history, the production and reproduction of a world. And while
narrative can also intervene in the space between, narrators cannot
separate themselves from the land in order to see it. In other words,
there is no outside in relation to ideology, just as there is no
outside of narrative. To deny narrative, to resist its claim upon us,
is not so much resisting ideology as it is ideologically blind to the
fact that without narrative we are bereft of the means of
counter-strategy in the face of dominant and oppressive ideological
orders. This is telling, this is our common practice whereby the
limits and truths of the world are negotiated. In the making of
history, every composition is the site of as many decompositions.
Rather than the solution to crisis, narrative is the performance of it
(this fault to which I return and from which I emerge again and
again); not a repetition of prefigured limitation, but a
renegotiation, an approach, a reaching out that defines the world.
Here, 'I' appears as a provisional place-holder at the site where a
subject is called and assumed. The 'call' is a critical trope in
Althusser's theory of ideology where 'interpellation' is said to
hail the subject into social being. Accordingly, the ahistorical
individual is called to assume the historical position of a socially
intelligible 'I'. But I like also to think that, appearing as a
third term between the determined and the indeterminate, 'I' is
equally the effect of misrecognitions, incommensurable both with the
name by which it is called and the name I call myself. Mistaken
audience, mistaken identity. 'I' holds the promise of some
non-identical content: 'you' my audience and 'he' my self.
Narrative denaturalizes whatever 'I' and naturalizes only the need
to narrate. The space of narrative, then, is one of intervention,
conversion, transfiguration: where one renders oneself other than
oneself in a paradoxical quest for a more truthful 'I'. Selves are
called and recalled in turn. Augustine's ethic of conversion and
Edward II's ethic of friendship both articulate ways of potential
resistance to a prior call by way of a new response. Ethics are
ideological, but they allow one to narrate one's imagined relations
to real conditions differently, that is, to imagine it differently.

## Critical faith


> Only, how are they to call upon the lord until they have learned to
> believe in him?*
>
>             --Saint Augustine



But how do we come to believe in the I that is called? Stein writes of
"...names being not existing because anybody can know what any body
else is talking about without any name being mentioning, without any
belief in the any name being existing." Without risking belief,
communication lies in state. And belief, situated on the other side of
doubt and uncertainty, must be born in the space between, the space of
the call itself. This recalls Althusser recalling Pascal writing (more
or less) that one gets down on one's knees and belief follows. But
with a critical difference: belief needn't refer to the uncritical
reproduction of a dominant call and response; it might rather refer to
one *abandoning* oneself to a space between incommensurable calls.
Perhaps this would be the space of neither belief nor doubt but of a
more critical faith whose subject, whose 'I', is attentive to the
paradox: for what (or who) is the subject of *abandon* if one's self
is the object? While belief is necessarily ideological, ideology
isn't unequivocally "bad": in fact, it is necessary. Like
narrative, ideology enables. Here again, the crisis, the plot:
narrative's origin, this doubling along the fault which I essays.
Augustine abandons himself to narrative and in doing so the stakes of
communication are raised without offering the security of a
predictable outcome. If coherent selfhood is only an effect of
narration, and if narration is always a potentially destabilizing
force, then security is always already preempted when one risks a
beginning. This is both the promise of narrative and its betrayal. And
this is what makes Augustine's **Confessions** an exquisite act of
love, as political as it is poetic. "If poetry is the calling upon a
name until that name comes to be anything if one goes on calling on
that name more and more calling upon that name as poetry does then
poetry does make that calling upon a name a narrative it is a
narrative of calling upon that name." [Stein] The poetic tradition,
however, itself ideologically informed, has connived with the market
of names---authorizing it in ways---a devaluing trade in which names
are used and exchanged calculably as guaranteed referents, their
faults concealed. *So as no appearance of any wound or hurt might
outwardly be at once perceived.* Thus has the very need to call been
obviated and the space between, from which another way may be reached,
occluded. I believe, however, that in relation to crisis, it is the
response-ability of narrative to restore our awareness of the need,
and intensify our desire for another way.


And only by way of narrative might we unriddle "this knot of
imaginary servitude that love must always undo again." ([^1_halpern_4])

# Laird Hunt: The Avenue



> _In my skull is an avenue I stroke_[^1_hunt_huntA]
> 
> --- Clark Coolidge

 

**There is an avenue** in my skull too---albeit one that is poorly
maintained, cavernously pitted, strewn with rubble, whole segments
blasted away; one that is curved, possibly circular, that, like the
backgrounds in cartoons, maddeningly repeats itself; one that is
ill-marked, with many a false turn-off and many a false vista; one
that is skewed out of proportion, that is frequently unsafe, almost
always unsavory; one that is troubled by converging lanes, of which
there are hundreds, that even resembles a parking lot in places and is
probably haunted---_hell of a place_[^1_hunt_huntB]. And yet, [I,
narrator][^1_hunt_huntC], stroke it, speak through its mess, speak of its
mess, multiply it. It's an interesting dilemma---aspects of which are
taken up in Adorno's seminal essay on the place of the narrator in
the contemporary novel---the narrator, with no story to narrate,
_narrates anyway_[^1_hunt_huntD], a story that has been blown to bits. Of
course not everyone sees it that way. We live in [an age of errata, of
misinformation, of disinformation, of hoax][^1_hunt_huntE]; perhaps it is
little wonder that there continues to be such a hunger for narratives
that, as Adorno describes them, largely by way of 19th century
techniques _mimic the real_[^1_hunt_huntF]; that say to us, with
disarming earnestness, this, my friends, is _how it was_[^1_hunt_huntG].
In the domain of the fictive narrative, I tend to have little patience
for such works. I am much more interested in (and seem only capable of
constructing) narratives that are to some degree aware of _the
provisional nature of their own authority_[^1_hunt_huntH], in which _the
fictive quality of recollection_[^1_hunt_huntI] is acknowledged, in which
_forgetting_[^1_hunt_huntJ] is considered the key constituent of memory,
and in which, finally, getting it right shares center stage with
getting it wrong.

[^1_hunt_huntB]:  For some years now Brenda Coultas, in her narratives, has been conjuring worlds to which multiple qualities of the preceding description might apply. Whether in her book **Early Films** (Rodent Press 1996) or in her recent chapbook **A Summer Newsreel** (Second
Story Books, 1999) Coultas is engaged in constructing usefully
disjunctive, lyric-enhanced investigations into landscapes that have
come apart. For me, part of the great thing about Coultas' writing is
that she brings an indomitable hunger for beauty to bear on her
cracked and spilling subjects.


[^1_hunt_huntC]:   E.g., Pamela Lu's terrific **Pamela: A Novel** (Atelos, 1998). A bildungsroman of sorts, an intricate chronicle of the coming awake of a highly-syntaxed consciousness, in which the greater part of the narrative seems to occur in between commas.


[^1_hunt_huntD]:  "The expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express." Samuel Beckett (in 1949 conversation with Georges Duthuit).
 

[^1_hunt_huntE]:   
The tendered premise in a recent episode of the X-Files: since World
War Two Americans have had an unquenchable appetite for 'bogus
revelation'; having determined this, the United States Government has
built, presumably as a cover for its more radical weapons of mass
destruction programs, an elaborate web of alien abduction and sighting
hoaxes. This hoax, we are led to believe, may or may not be one. At
the end, intrigued to a ghastly degree, we are left both believing
(the elements of documentary inherent in the X-Files aiding this
process) that there are aliens around and that the Government has
cooked up (and deployed) weapons even more diabolical than the ones it
has copped to. This tv 'fiction' seems to me only slightly less
credible than what the evening news, reporting live from the White
House! serves up, or than the gamut of what can be found gathered up
daily in **The New York Times**. (The day after watching the X-Files
episode I read allegations by Puerto Rican petitioners at the United
Nations that the United States Government was testing uranium-capped
bullets at its facility on Vieques Island; during the debate an Iraqi
delegate stated that similar weapons had been used during the Gulf
War.)


[^1_hunt_huntF]: 
Harry Mathews, who, in part of his work, has vertiginously built upon
(see **The Conversions and Tlooth**, recently reissued by Dalkey
Archive), the wonderful, strange narratives of Raymond Roussel, had
this to say in a recent interview in Rain Taxi: "The great discovery
I made through him [Roussel] was that you didn't have to write
about what happened the day you fell in the swimming pool, but that
you could invent your own swimming pool that had never existed before,
full of quicksilver, lighted by imaginary lamps." Which, abstracted,
might lead to a formula something like, The writer is in the world;
the writing is in the writer. Or, looking at it from a reader-oriented
perspective, we might arrive at: The writing is in the reader; the
reader is in the world; Either way we are dealing with a considerable
degree of mediation. One I am interested in.



[^1_hunt_huntG]: 
"The more strictly the novel adheres to realism in external things,
to the gesture that says 'this is how it was,' the more every word
becomes a mere 'as if,' and the greater becomes the contradiction
between this claim and the fact that it was not so." (Adorno, "The Position of the Narrator in the Contemporary Novel")



[^1_hunt_huntH]: 
Among contemporary works, the narratives of W.G. Sebald (**The
Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn**) are exemplary in this regard,
pointing up, as they do, against the backdrop of this bloody century
(and with an apercu of others), the enormous difficulty of fixing
experience, both personal and collective. Keith Waldrop's harrowing
memoir **Light While There Is Light** (which calls itself fiction) is
another example. As is David Markson's intriguing **Wittgenstein's
Ladder**.





[^1_hunt_huntI]: 
Ryonusuke Akutagawa brilliantly treats aspects of this in a pair of
stories which were later combined and made into the much more famous
film **Rashomon** by Akira Kurosawa. Aaron Shurin writes, in passing,
in his 1990 essay "Narrativity," of the 'irreversible solidity of
the past tense.' I've lately begun to marvel, because of this
generally ascribed quality, that History continues to be written in
it. It was Herodotus, Father of History, who kicked things
off---neatly blending directly observed incident/object with reported
incident/object with rumored incident/object with imagined
incident/object. At least a good part of what gets built into the past
tense, then, is hardly irreversible, hardly solid. Pretty slippery, in
fact.




[^1_hunt_huntJ]:  
Walter Benjamin writes beautifully on this in the opening pages of his
essay, "The Image of Proust" (**Illuminations**): "For the important
thing for the remembering author is not what he experienced, but the
weaving of his memory, the Penelope work of recollection. Or should
one call it, rather, a Penelope work of forgetting? Is not the
involuntary recollection, Proust's memoire involuntaire, much closer
to forgetting than what is usually called memory? And is not this work
of spontaneous recollection, in which remembering is the woof and
forgetting the warf, a counterpart to Penelope's work rather than its
likeness? For here the day unravels what the night has woven. When we
awake each morning, we hold in our hands, usually weakly and loosely,
but a few fringes of the tapestry of lived life, as loomed for us by
forgetting. However, with our purposeful activity and, even more, our
purposive remembering each day unravels the web and the ornaments of
forgetting. This is why Proust finally turned his days into nights,
devoting all his hours to undisturbed work in his darkened room with
artificial illumination, so that none of those intricate arabesques
might escape him."

# Trevor Joyce: Why I Write Narrative





**But, first**: why not? A chain of telling that requires discrete and
distinct figures, already in some sense familiar, acting across a
background, largely unexamined and abandoned merely to suggestion,
towards the achievement of, or the failure to achieve, certain goals,
whose importance holds the earlier periods in suspense until in some
final resolution all that is significant crystallizes in a perfection
of plot and motivation, and all the rest, wanting any real brush with
language, retreats once more to ground: that's narrative as I knew it
thirty years ago, and it seemed then, as it does now, inadequate to
the world of my experience.


To avoid the fate of perpetrating such stuff, I instead wrote a poetry
which found itself increasingly characterized by argument,
deploration, pleading, threats, until I realized that I didn't like
how that worked either, and stopped writing altogether for about
twenty years.


But I went on thinking and planning and testing and learning, though
largely just in imagination. I took a shine to the detective genre in
which, in theory, any object or event can be a clue and, as such, be
exalted into meaning as the everyday world sifts through the riddle of
observation, inference and deduction. But, even there, the world
existed only towards an end in which all might be revealed, and the
head of Holmes had a strictly limited inventory capacity.


Eventually, it was only in the parallel forensics of Gombrowicz's
"Cosmos" that I found some satisfaction with detection, since
nothing is revealed there, and the patterns and clues are rubbish and
trivial chatter remains fraught, even on rereading.


I had by this time resumed writing poetry, though with conventional
narrative either expunged or twisted, and temporal change borne
instead by repetition, either incremental or with calculated
variation. My models for this were in the refrain structures of
folk-song, often mediated through the likes of Yeats or Lorca, and in
the interplay of stasis and movement in Chinese parallel verse. I was
forced to recognize, however, that the 'lyric' mode which I
practiced was quite as prone to exclude the incoherent world as was
the mannered narrative I so distrusted. I had also encountered Cage
for a second time, and with more understanding of how the play of
ambient noise across the receptivity of his spaces might circumvent
those exclusions and admit what might otherwise not be acknowledged.


I wrote a longish 'bicameral' piece called **Syzygy**, consisting of
two halves, "The Drift" and "The Net" respectively. "The Drift"
consists of twelve compact, elliptical, but distinctly 'lyric'
poems. "The Net" is a single poem of 72 long lines, comprising 24
three-line stanzas. Significantly these two sections are made up of
exactly the same phrases reordered, rigorously and exhaustively mapped
through a one-to-one matrix, the exact structuring of which is not
directly relevant here. There is a brief set of notes added, which
ground some of the detailed references of "The Drift" within the
empirical world.


For me, much of the significance of the poem is in the way in which
sequences of phrases in "The Net," arrived at through the blind
deploymen of predetermined procedures, carry a force both of lyricism
and of narrative, intense though severely fragmented in both cases,
which revealed a meaning different from and additional to anything I
had deliberately written into the work. Having lived with it for over
two years now, I have come to understand that "with the first dream
of fire they hunt the cold" and how "devastation fell attending
headbone the high" while "outside the foundries the clumsy the
deadlocked disintegrates" though "not a tremor manifests the rare
the quickening across these settlements" . So, I had confirmed for
myself that a densely overdetermined language, functioning in its most
intensely personal mode of the lyric, could survive radical disruption
and return from that alienation a yield which the reader might gather.
It gave the world an in.


I had meanwhile read all the Fu Manchu novels of Sax Rohmer, intrigued
the Chinese Doctor's ceaseless attempts to appropriate the world by
abducting experts in all fields, whose task was to analyse and
replicate in enhanced form all aspects of the workaday world. It
matched my sense as a child that what I saw in mirrors was a world
diligently assembled by unseen agents to match that which I inhabited,
and I watched carefully for small discrepancies to justify that sense,
but never found them, and the specialists of Fu Manchu's underworld
empire attended only to the great realms of science, technology,
politics, always were disbanded by resurgent law before their analysis
could address the classified advertisments in the newspapers, the torn
betting slips outside a bookie's shop, the inconsequential gabbling
of drunks in a pub. The workings of what I came to know, through Marx,
Adorno and Benjamin, as phantasmagoria fascinated and appalled me. And
how is responsibility to be assigned across mock-worlds if not through
the causal chains which are narrative's stock-in-trade?


Therefore:


| while detailed depositions state
| how further on
| within the wood
| . . .

| the bright axe
| blossom suddenly

| the long bones lever
| up from it like anthers
| and beyond the startling
| calyx of teeth

| an avid buzzing perishable
| fruit set thicken
| and disintegrate
| to load with sweet

| secure deposits
| of afflicting gold
| their remote cells . . .


Here is not just one narrative, but two. Firstly, the sequence of
blossoming, the detail of anther and calyx expanding, the fruiting
adumbrated in the gathering of bees about the flower, and their
dispersal to the hive where they load the cells with honey. This
apparently natural and value-free sequence is overlaid on another
causal chain, which starts with the felling of a tree by a logger with
an axe (commercial or strategic deforestation has a long and
significant history in Ireland as in much of the developing world
today). From this action, the causal sequence is run backwards,
seeking earlier sources where responsibility may be assigned: the long
bones of the arm, the gasping jaw of the labourer, give way to the
investors depositing their profits in banks. This single instance is
simple, but the structure of reversed causality running back from an
act of violence against the person or ecological ruin, masked
meanwhile by a natural sequence of a bird fledging or a mineral
cystallizing, is repeated twice more in the poem, broken by cases for
and against the possibility of asylum amid such wilderness. Here, I
began again to write narrative because the forensic process it allows
seemed to me necessary to any possibility of living ethically, of
recognizing and fulfilling due responsibility.


Another narrative genre which interested me is that of scientific
experiment, where the researcher actively intervenes in the course of
nature, attempting to limit the causal influences at work, so that one
element may be manipulated, and the change in another, dependent
element, observed and measured. It is intended that the record of
correct prediction and accurate calculation of effect may then grant
understanding of what was previously obscure.


"A body thrown vertically down from the top of a tower moves through
a distance of 88 feet during the third second of its flight.
Calculate, then, the speed of projection, and determine the speed at
which the sleeve begins to move upwards."


And yet, it is in a field complex with uncertainty, that we attempt to
understand, to categorize, to measure, and the experimenter must
attempt to exclude all forces not considered relevant to the
investigation, and accurately account for all that ensues.


"When he attempted to speak to her, the patient jumped off the bridge
falling some 30 feet into about 20 feet of water. There is always a
chance therefore that the critical act or change may take place when
the observer's eyes are withdrawn."


Yet we must dispassionately observe, measure and record.


"Mild plethora of the face ensued, it being divided into three parts,
namely: the forehead, fair complected, one; the nose, another, sand
present in abundance there admixed with small crustacean shells; and
from the nose to chin, exhibiting extensive tooth loss though with
roots intact, another. Notice the blood tinged fluid coming from
mouth. Red is warm and radiates across the ground."


In such a manner, sometimes we come to face what can scarcely be
countenanced.


"It may happen that we are not aware of all the conditions under
which our researches are made. Some substance may be present or some
power may be in action, which escapes the most vigilant examination.
Not being aware of its existence, we are unable to take proper
measures to exclude it, and thus determine the share which it has in
the results of our experiments."


Though the outcome be uncertain, may we still presume to have advanced
knowledge in certain quarters? Lacking the machinery of suspense, to
what end may such a narrative aspire?


"A man has several bones in all, and beauty is lost when meaning and
form are split asunder. The handsome man must be swarthy, and the
woman fair, etc., the genitalia, both internal and external, without
injury. Provisional diagnosis: probable drowning. And had we exhausted
all the known phenomena of a mechanical problem, how can we tell that
hidden phenomena, as yet undetected, do not intervene in the commonest
actions? I will not tell you about the irrational animals, because you
will never discover any system of proportion in them."


The plausibility of narrative is increasingly an issue for me, and not
without reason, perhaps, given the dominance of contending
master-narratives in the interpretation of the Irish past and,
consequently, in my present world. From such master-narratives it
seems worth trying to retrieve as much as may still have value. I have
tried this in a recent long work called "Trem Neul"---part prose, part
'verse'---which I see as, in part, an attempt to recoup part of the
history of my world from what Beckett terms 'the uniform memory of
intelligence'. "Genealogies. The elementary tables. Dictionaries,
assembled in blind frosts. Grammar and chronology. Libraries. Index:
the Encyclopaedia, damascened with ice. So is the perfect body of
knowledge dislimned."


How may one conduct a narrative of change, of loss and recovery, of
breakage and continuity, without presuming the existence of distinct
agents, freeing them incredibly from their ground, and committing a
plotwork of events, utterly plausible because familiar and foreknown?
Scholarship has shown us how the integrity and closure of the human
agent was arrived at in early Greek poetry, must we take that achieved
unity as more than provisional? Can we not tell without it?


"We build ourselves through the world and each through other, and
this proceeds to death as the world alters with experience." The
bodies in this plot are not distinct, either from one another or from
their ground, they emerge to make themselves, enjoy a transitory
closure, and then resolve again into a ground which offers further
figures. "When the biology of your body breaks down, the skin has to
be cut so as to give access to the inside. Later it has to be sewn
back like memory, when it may house all knowledge. Memory is our
comfort and our attire. Fashioned with our hands it is the
accomplishment of our dreams and lapses; always a meaningful pattern
though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of sub-patterns.
Pretend I'm lost and try to find me."


Because I wish to work comprehensively with the world which I inhabit,
however, and because that world is current with named identities, I
have admitted one such, and one specific narrating voice to speak of
him. I have permitted myself also two specific occasions in time, one
exactly situated starting at about 11 a.m. on February 15th. 1838),
one not. Between the two is a connection, and my essay is to account
for that, to recount it. "Do not think it coincidental that memory
should begin to fail just as taxonomies become a prominent tool for
thought."


As, I believe Braudel and the Annales school refocused history on the
wholeness of ordinary lives, their habits, orientations and crises, by
attending patiently to things left, I see my present course, of
rendering the experience of connectedness, as being sustainable only
through exercising a similar patience with language. No longer
expecting to find there an exact mirror-image of the world I know, but
rather to have it deliver me one I don't.


| We will read
| every day
| in the afternoon
| When shall we learn
| to write?
| We shall soon
| learn
| I once went
| to Europe
| but I do not now
| remember
| what I saw
| there

It is in preferring to concentrate on the unpredictable ground rather
than to people it with puppets of my own making that I have elected in
these more recent pieces to work increasingly through collage. Each
fragment of language I adopt is already tale-bearing, a vector:
carrier from a prior host, director of action also across the space of
my world. And the point of such a narrative? Interim figures on an
interim ground; preservation of the complex weave of actions, not
denouement; attachment understood embraced abandoned; wanting
executive or summary.

# Kevin Killian: Poison






**I'm standing** on a flat plain, and then, or so it seems, a little hole
appears in the sand ahead of me (like that movie **Tremors**)? The
hole grows larger in diameter, this is my sanity, and all the little
pieces of my sanity are breaking up and slipping down into the hole.
That's what it feels like. I'm trying to write this piece,
"Poison," about the ways in which the writer's personality
dissolves as it weaves in and out of the sentences he or she so
painfully struggles to produce. While writing it I notice a host of
familiar symptoms. Nobody calls me on the phone. I feel so isolated. I
can't hear very well and wonder if I'm going deaf like Beethoven,
like Brian Wilson. When people do speak it's with loud, ultra-charged
voices, as though they're annoyed with me. I feel like I'm losing my
mind and with my mind, the meaning of life I once held onto. I used to
think that people are basically good at heart. I used to think I would
be happy someday, but now I feel differently, that there's no chance
for me, since that hole before me is opening up and soon everything I
ever clung to will be sucked down into it and I'll be homeless and
curled up on the gutter outside my former apartment on Minna Street, a
crack-ridden block South of Market in San Francisco. I just bought a
car and there's not really any place to park it.


How did I write a whole book? I'm trying to remember. In particular
how I wrote **Bedrooms have Windows**, which I loved so much too, I
wrote it in part as a shipwreck victim sends out a message in a
bottle; in particular to my dear friend Terry Black, with whom I'd
lost touch a few years before. The book has many appeals to him to get
in touch with me. (Before the Internet, through which, apparently,
everyone is available to or traceable by everyone else, this seemed my
only recourse.) I longed to see it in print, feeling that he would
pick it up and call me. But after it was published a mutual friend
sent me Terry's obituary, he had died in Richmond, Virginia, of AIDS,
the same month the memoir came out. This was not the answer I had
hoped for. Part of me felt that **Bedrooms have Windows** killed Terry
Black---detailing as it did our sex life and its creation, the way we
had made up sex to answer certain suburban needs for the authentic,
the "real," the colorful. Naming names, his. Implicating others,
him. What portion of one's personality is a fiction? It wasn't going
to do any good to realize this was a sentimental fantasy, part of the
mind's response to the inexplicable horror of AIDS, part of my own
need to find myself on centerstage always. I went back to "Poison"
as I delivered it originally, as a talk in Bob Gluck's series, *In
Context*, a series of talks delivered week after week at Intersection,
once an important writing venue in San Francisco. This was a happier
time for me---April, 1987. When New Narrative writing seemed wide
open, a place where something entirely new under the sun could be
created. And that we were doing it, doing so. But "Poison" I found
out was imperfect, it didn't help me. "Last week Dodie Bellamy's
talk stressed the paradox of writing as a two-way street-the
importation of the world into the self, and the generous export of the
self back into the world. Bob's talk may have been allied to my own
idea of writing as an expression of the death drive from **Beyond the
Pleasure Principle**---what he calls 'Freudian pleasure based on an
instinct to return to the inanimate.'"


Every writing act is an act of dying, or killing, or mortification.
Every time I write it's to expose to the air of the page a false part
of my personality. ---I guess this goes directly against Bob's theory
of writing, and links mine closer to Dodie's, though not in any way
she'd like or approve of. My talk, I thought, would be a patchwork of
quotations, writing about me written by others; some that I wrote
about other people, lots I wrote about myself, and also work by others
that didn't have me in it at all---to give a wide scale against which
I could test my propositions. And the first was from Alan Davies'
book **Name**, which I found useful in its treatment of the tie
between language and self; is language a function of the word or of
the self? Or vice versa?

| The cryptic tongue.
| We are getting ourselves
| in the mood to have been
| done with having been done
| with this again.
| It's all very irreversible
| which is what
| makes its guts open up.
| I wonder how long it will
| be until this writes
| itself, in
| my direction. And we
| haven't proved
| that it isn't true yet.
| When I think of you
| the sentences come,
| but I don't.



Then I read a passage from Dodie's book **The Letters of Mina
Harker**, in which Mina, a fictional character, reflects on her love
life. In this passage I felt myself inextricably named and described,
my human body a vessel for a flood of narrative concerns.


Flaccid, KK's penis is endearing, so velvety and shy---but the
trouble with babies (as my mother always said) is that they grow
up---your bed inflates to the breaking point with
thirty-three-year-old male desire panting and prodding *the thing
inside burst through her belly, horror props, sausage links and
ketchup* around my neck KK fastens a locket filled with a snip of his
hair *to protect me from evil* I cross the street with my eyes closed,
cars screech then cease to exist, the atom remains unsplit forever,
cells multiply at a reasonable rate every death is from a natural
cause LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE remember when his
nails were half an inch long, thick, hard, yellowed---he clipped them
off for me parting my capillary pink flesh without a scratch *all it
took was one "ouch"* claws retract, breathing softens. He extends
his palm from the bathtub and says, "Sit on it," human form follows
function, in Cocteau's **Beauty and the Beast** gloved arms poke out
of the walls holding candles, their flames trembling as Beauty recedes
down the endless corridor *I wish I could walk through mirrors* our
entwined bodies tighten into a circle, a champagne bubble about to be
swallowed by Marilyn Monroe *pushing the metaphor to the breaking
point, in a word: orgasmic* when we fuck we are two great hands
shaking *his cock a thumb* in an explosion of light the bearded
creator in Blake's watercolor points from the heavens---mortal heads
bow or stare up in awe and terror the way I do whenever I'm naked *a
woman's hair is never thick enough to hide her thoughts* KK reaches
for a condom, fumbles with its little blue capsule PRESS FIRMLY ON DOT
AND PULL APART *town fathers pack data in time capsules burying them
underground, schoolchildren dig them up, crack them open a hundred
years later. Things.*



I used to ask Dodie, "Shouldn't it be, 'When we fuck we are two
great hands shaking his cock a *giant* thumb?' Wouldn't that make
the passage clearer?"
She said, "No." That's all. Just "no."

At first I was embarrassed by this passage and many others like it in
her writing, for if at any time my penis is flaccid I don't want to
know about it, nor the world to suspect it. At the same time, I felt
flattered, singled out by her language as I felt singled out by her
love. "Beauty recedes down the endless corridor *I wish I could walk
through mirrors*." The sense of the syntax issues a seductive
invitation into a mystery world---and I am that mystery. Then the cold
water hit me; with a start I came to and asked the difficult question,
is it I who is being described? *The Letters of Mina Harker* seem to
describe the sex lives, the love lives of two actual people, but of
course they don't, they don't even especially want to: their veiled
and mediating nature hints at this:


---extends his palm from the bathtub and says, "Sit on it," human
form follows function, in Cocteau's **Beauty and the Beast** gloved
arms poke out of the walls holding candles, their flames trembling as
Beauty recedes down the endless corridor

---and so forth, then the phrase "pushing the metaphor to the
breaking point" nails it. Do you know the funny feeling you get when
a stranger waves on the street, you wave back, and then you realize
the stranger's waving not at you but at the little weirdo behind you
in the brown fedora? One's identification with the words that seem to
conjure one up like "I Dream of Jeannie" out of black letters on a
white page is like---just like-the way your heart then sinks and a
blush colors your face; except it's even more mortifying---that
stranger on the street's waving all right, and you wave back, then
you turn around and it isn't even a person that stranger is really
waving at, but an atmosphere perhaps, a draft of air. Only convention
associates the wave (or the sentence) to a corporeal body like one's
own.

My next example I wrote. I quoted from **Bedrooms have Windows** to
give some idea of what goes through a writer's head when he decides
to name real people in potentially scandalous situations-sexual in
this case, but scandalous only insofar as they deal with the body;
also to suggest the peculiar vanity of the writer-and then I'll give
it a fairly close reading.


One evening several years ago I was lying in bed, after some
unsatisfactory fumbles towards "safe sex" with a writer I once
admired, Dennis A. He turned his head-exactly as he'd turned mine, an
hour earlier---and get this, he said, "Why didn't you think to take
home that Tom Boll too and we could have had a threesome." "Why
didn't I think," I replied, an echo of disbelief. "Dennis, I did
think; I thought and thought. Had I thought any more, I wouldn't be
having this safe sex. Madness wouldn't have been safe from me." I
felt attracted to him when he spelled his name in plastic magnetized
letters on Aaron's refrigerator. Then he spelled mine with the same
colorful letters. Language fused. It was like William Carlos Williams.
"There were plums in that icebox," I said to him. "Forgive me.
Forgive me. I couldn't help it; they were so ripe and so purple and
so cold."


I doubt if "memoir," the word "memoir," really disguises from the
reader, or listener, that something very close to a real event is
being described. And naturally many people will correctly identify
"Dennis A.," the writer "I used to admire," with the Australian
historian and sociologist Dennis Altman. I figured out that I call him
"Dennis A." to make the narrator's personality kind of coy and
obnoxious---and it works, doesn't it? Maybe I was miffed because the
sex we had wasn't very perfect---or maybe I thought, "He's
forgotten about me, I'll employ this sentence to haunt him." Writing
as an act of revenge, and naming names a superior way of taking it.
Like a virus, the poison of this passage will break down, over time,
whatever goodwill and nice feeling that I---my body---will have by
then created---like some ghastly race between life and death, immune
system and viral infection. Bob's novel Jack the Modernist begins
with a paradigm of intention, deadly intention, "You're not a lover
till you blab about it," where the ugliness of the syllable "blab"
is meant to suggest a whole medicine cabinet's worth of emetic
antidotes to the possibly-too-pretty word "lover."

The same watchful watchdogs will naturally conclude that this pick-up
scene takes place not just in anyone's kitchen, in the kitchen not
just of any old Aaron, but in Aaron Shurin's kitchen. Maybe they
already know of my admiration for his writing and his influence. When
I first met him I had just read his book **The Graces**, and I was so
struck by it I could hardly connect its author with a living human
being; it was, maybe, a gift from another planet like something out of
Chariots of the Gods. And since then I've gotten to know Aaron better
"as a person," but still blitzed by this admiration which---I see
now!---is another form of objectification, turned outward instead of
inward. Hence there was little psychic difficulty in turning his name,
like a totem, into an amulet to adorn my prose. Hence the repulsive,
shy-making casualness of using that name, "Aaron," and the
social-climbing note its use strikes here, as though I were his
intimate, or perhaps his boyfriend, and what is it in actuality but an
incursion on him, aimed squarely at him at his most domestic and
private, the kitchen setting, the letters on the refrigerator, perhaps
the implied sneer (leftover from the 60s) that the letters are made of
plastic. A plastic language. Doesn't sound like a recommendation,
does it? It's true that telling stories, "narrative," does involve
a local, in the sense that this quote of mine does have a certain
atmosphere, a sophistication, but it isn't really mine, it's
borrowed or stolen, the way you or I might borrow someone's boyfriend
or wife, return it to them and destroy a relationship like breaking a
milk bottle. (This isn't to suggest I haven't thought of the
pleasure it brings to writer and reader both, but---maybe because I'm
a Catholic---it's a guilty pleasure; there's pleasure in guilt too,
and even if there isn't there's the dying fall you get when you
string one word after another, after another, onto another, like bugle
beads. The pleasure of accretion.)


Next I'll read something I wrote for the "Jack Spicer" issue of
**ACTS**. My intention here was to get at what I saw as the malice
characteristic of Spicer's poetics, and I couldn't think of another
analogy except to describe an occasion from my own life, an occasion
when I felt malice directed at me.



My aim was to develop a visceral writing, a writing that would as
closely as possible parallel the effects of the anonymous letter:
insult, horror, shock and embarrassment. But did my face turn red when
I received one myself:

Dear Kevin Killian:
Your piece "Tom-Tom" in the latest issue of **No Apologies** aroused
my suspicion that you must be an asshole. First of all what is a gay
man doing writing about a psycho-killer of women and getting off on
it? I'm suspicious that it's easier for your fantasy screw to get
off when the victim is a (dehumanized) "Miss Thing" than if your
homicidal maniac lusted after boys like---just like-you . . . So
what's your story? If it isn't a good one, this dyke'll write you
off entirely.

Threats. Intimidation. A whole map of misreading of my adorable piece.
Again and again I read this letter, each time with increasing unease
and paranoia. I howled into the open air, "What have I done to
deserve such venom? Who wrote this tripe?" Despite the writer's
declaration, I wasn't fooled into believing him a woman. In my heart
I knew this letter is from one of my so-called friends-of the male
species. My only questions were, which one---and why? I'd been put
into the abject position, one I was to maintain for a long time.
Writing produces deracination, I decided, by own best example. So much
for theory. My content upset "her," I thought to myself. "Take away
the psycho-killer storyline and there'd be nothing even a child would
object to." And "her" form upset me. Isn't "dictation" Jack
Spicer's word for "receiving the letter"? You don't know where it
comes from; so you react badly. Martians are writing you, altering the
furniture in your room. I wanted a drink so bad I wound up in North
Beach! Bats flying from wall to wall, the whole schmear, and voices
writing all my poems and signing them with Dennis Cooper's name!

Here the dominant note of my writing becomes real plain: I'm talking
about hysteria. I mean that seriously enough, a line that runs a beat
too fast, that's capable of all sorts of unexpected connections
(which is good) but because it's hysterical is equally capable of
making false connections or ignoring the valid (which is bad). That is
to say, in my heart of hearts I don't really believe Dennis Cooper is
signing all my poems. Why, I don't even know what I meant by that.
That's paranoid, isn't it? But I had to find out, what are my rights
as a narrator and character?

When I put myself in this false position, I run the risk all divas
take: we might prove too much for even our greatest fans. And so I've
noticed the characteristic note when others write about me is comic,
often picking on my frailties as a real person and usually, by the
way, noting either that I love the stars, drink a lot of Tab, or also,
you know, drink a lot, of, you know, alcohol. The next passage is from
a story by Francesca Rosa called "Canidae" (the Latin word for
"dogs"). In it I thought I recognized myself as the writer, "K.":



As K. speaks, a worried-looking dog pokes its head through the blue
gauze curtains separating the reading area from whatever is behind it.
A black dog, except that its fur is so sparse the skin shows through,
a gray and black dog then with running eyes; the wattles of its throat
a livid pink. It brings the rest of its body through the curtain and
walks upstage of K. who is telling us a story about Long Island. The
dog explores, listlessly sniffs at the floor, the podium base and
K.'s ankles. It walks back and forth a few times, turns a slow circle
while digging its teeth into the root of its tail, and then stops to
stare at us, the listeners, again. Not at all shy, confident, as if
resigned in its desolation, like one of those Kafka characters that
have survived their own death. K. does not, or decides not to, notice
his center stage companion, and takes us from Long Island to New York
and then back again.



When I first heard this story I remember she was sitting on stage and
I was sitting in the audience, our narratological positions reversed,
and my ears got red, and a voice rose up in me with a strangled
scream, "You can dish it out, Kevin, but you sure can't take it!"
In Bob's talk,"Truth's Mirror is No Mirror," he says, "I wonder
if we are at the point of reversing Flaubert . . . by accepting an
artificial self, with its own scale, depth and continuity. Eastern
religion responds to a 'made-up' world with compassion---but with a
fatalism that is the flip side of Flaubert's scorn. To the degree we
'see through' Flaubert's scorn, we suffer from and enjoy a
self-contempt that is close to bragging . . . I wonder if it's
possible to be aware of the artifacted nature of the local and not be
contemptuous of it?---to understand it as a construct and be moved by
its depth?"


I was telling my sister Maureen that I was giving a talk on the
fiction of personality, and she nodded and said she knew what that's
about. Sometimes, she said, when she's walking down the street she
hears in her head her theme music so she feels she's starring in her
own TV show. Elizabeth Bowen wrote, "Nothing gets on the page that
you started with, and nothing you started gets on the page. To
write," she said, "is to rave a little." To this formation I've
added my own strategy, to rave a little before I begin to write, to
exploit the "fiction of personality" and to see, if not blinded by
the brushfire, what happens then on the page. When I was seventeen and
living in my parents' house on Long Island I threw lots of parties,
so did my friends Terry Black and Lance Mallamo, we did so to enjoy
ourselves and to write about them afterwards. This is from a story one
of them wrote about a party I gave, a story that begins with me
warning my parents to stay away from my party and my fun and my
personality and my fictions:


"All I know," pouted Kevin, "is that I care about this house as
much as anyone else and I think you're a hideous couple even to think
I'd let anything happen to it. Why I just can't explain the chills
that go up my spine every time I see it. It's like finding a lemonade
stand in the middle of a desert. When I think about the beauty and
splendor of this house tears come into my eyes. Its white walls, its
grapefruit shingles, its collapsible mailbox, the one-of-a-kind sodded
lawn, and, to top it all off like the cherry on a banana split, I
think our Spot, our pedigreed dog, out in the backyard rolling in mud
and barking at all passersby as if to say, 'I'm black and I'm
proud!'"


Kevin's fit of love and tears was interrupted by the doorbell. "I
just want to say one more thing," he said in a hurt voice. "If I see
either of you downstairs from now until tomorrow morning at ten
o'clock I'll set both of you on fire. Don't think I don't mean it
either because I'm pretty sure that I do."


With that he stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.


Later in the story Terry himself is in a car driving to my party.


"Terry," said Mary Phipps, a girl in the back seat. While drinking a
swig from a bottle of cheap apple wine she continued, "I'm glad
you're acting like yourself again instead of like Kevin Killian."


"Thank you," the courteous Terry replied through gritted teeth. Mary
Phipps smiled at him and he could not help smiling back. They were
true friends and he knew he should listen to what she had to say
whether he liked what she said or not. So he did.


"Not that we don't like Kevin," joined in another good friend of
Terry's named Sam Rye. "It's just that you're not him and we liked
you better as you."


Terry resigned himself to the friendly rainstorm of advice, opinions
and admonitions that followed. He could not help wondering though why
it was that Kevin always got almost all the attention and he, Terry,
so little.


But I've argued myself into a corner if I insist that New Narrative
makes room for the stupid, the overblown, and the nasty---these are
three different veins of my writing, each with its own jet flow. The
bizarre thing was that, after I delivered this talk on April 27, 1987,
the woman who had written me the anonymous poison-pen letter lifted
her hand from the audience and said, "Oh, I wrote that---before I
knew you better." Do we get to know people that much better that we
can change our minds so quickly about them? I was stunned. I remain
stunned. I think of life as a big empty desert place---cooler than
Death Valley---but just about as big---"I know! Let's call it Life
Valley!"

Where, as I pause for a second, clearing my head, trying not to write,
dragging myself from that particular abyss of memory and missed
opportunity, there a small hole appears before me, about fifteen feet
before me. And all the things I brought with me to this valley are in
my trailer, fifteen yards behind. And one by one I lose them down the
ever-expanding hole---cans, jars, movie magazines, photos, food and
books. The hole keeps caving in on itself. My little home on wheels is
silver, rounded like the new Volkswagen models, and drives like a
dream. Its doors shear off with a sudden crunch of metal, bright in
the noon air, they slither across the desert floor into the hole. I'm
next perhaps, hold on to me.




# Chris Kraus: Hunger -- Technology -- Emotion




From my LA diary ---


Los Angeles, sometime in the late 90s ---


**My heart and stomach** flip while waiting in the endless gourmet
take-out line at Say Cheese on Hyperion. This is the third full day
not eating .... I stare through thick plate-glass at tureens of baby
peas in mayonnaise. Ten bucks a quarter pound, they're canned. Little
bits of foreign cheese displayed on the top shelf like so many sad
specimens. English tilton, camembert. From the bodies of imprisoned
animals to the air-conditioned case, it's obvious this food was never
touched with love or understanding. The chubby woman up ahead of me
seems to think this food is good. She is luxuriating in the moment
when she speaks her choices to the shop girl, even though the girl is
bored and hardly even listening. I'd hoped to trick myself to eat by
ordering the most exquisite food but now this place offends me. Say
Cheese, Say Choose. She wraps the names of foods around her tongue,
pleased with her passable pronunciation. Why do I hate everything? The
food here is so vastly overpriced, it no longer smells like food, it
smells like bills and coins and plastic.


If I'm not touched it becomes impossible to eat. It's only after
sex, sometimes, that I can eat a little. When I'm not touched my skin
feels like the flip side of a magnet.


The Alien penetrated me very slowly as we sat together on the bed.
(This is Ulrike Meinhof speaking to the inhabitants of Earth ....As
the rope was tightening around my neck I lost perception but regained
all my consciousness and discernment. An Alien made love with me ...)
Uncovering his body takes my breath away. The paleness of it
underneath the soft dark hair. The Alien was naked. I had several of
my clothes on. We're very still. Fibrational quivers between our
bodies in the dark. "This's exactly how I imagined it would be. So
smooth." It now becomes possible to say anything. Low voice. "Don't
move." "I like to hear your breathing."


Like me, the Alien is anorexic. Sometimes we talk about our
malabsorption problems. Everything turns to shit. Food's
uncontrollable. If only it were possible to circumvent the throat, the
stomach and the small intestine and digest food just by seeing. After
several weeks the Alien decides that he will no longer make love to me
because I'm "not the One." Aliens spend their lifetimes on this
planet testing, searching. They get dewy-eyed, nostalgic about
hometown virgins.


I'm in my kitchen making chicken noodle soup for the Alien. It's his
fifth day of withdrawal from valium and heroin. He can't walk, can't
sleep. I want so much for him to eat. Even though he says he doesn't
love me, I can't believe it's true. Therefore, I want to help him.
"How about a nice piece of wholewheat toast?" I ask, ladling out his
soup. "Don't take offense by this," he says, "but there's
something I have to tell you. Your cunt smells bad. If you washed the
way you should, I would've done the things to you I do to all my
other girlfriends." I gasp. Soup spills. "Sorry," he says. "I
guess I should've mentioned it when we were dating."


Food stripped of all its color, nutrients and smells and then
reconstituted, like my expensive hair (he loves it), Ravissant Salon,
$300, like suburban small town cunts drenched in Massengil.


If I could only eat, a little ---


Although no one, to my knowledge, has analyzed the work of Frederich
Nietzsche through the occurrence of his blinding headaches, the poet
Kenneth Rexroth reads Simone Weil's philosophy through her anorexia.
Both are "egregious nonsense ... unholy folly." Rexroth puts lays
the blame where it belongs; on the Catholic men, Gustave Thibon and
Father Perrin, who took her seriously. "If only," Rexroth speculated
in **The Nation** (1957), "she had sought out an unsophisticated
parish priest, who would have told her 'Come, come, my child, what
you need is to get baptized, obey the Ten Commandments, forget about
religion, put some meat on your bones and get a husband' ..."


What you need is a good fuck, he said to me.


In **Holy Anorexia**, the scholar Rudolph Bell wants to take the
magnificence of the medieval female saints and drag them down to his
own level. He does this by conflating them with contemporary teenage
girls, who he finds pathetic and ridiculous. St. Catherine, St.
Theresa, and Hildegaard van Bingham are all essentially the same;
they're solipsistic brats. The collective trans-historic She, the
holy anorexic, "emerges from a frightened insecure psychic world to
become a champion of spiritual perfection .... Her will is to do
God's will, and she alone claims to know God's will." The holy
anorexic is a manipulative vixen; she "commands the war against her
body and therefore suffers deeply at every defeat, whether it is a
plate of food she gobbles down or a disturbing flagellation by nude
devils and wild beasts. Then with varying degrees of success, the holy
radical"---like the newly slender teenage girl---"begins to feel
victorious ..."


Like witches, or female writers, thinkers, artists, who use the names
of others when chronicling their lived experience, holy anorexics are
not merely people to be differed with; they must be despised.


Shouldn't it be possible to leave the body? Is it wrong to even try?
Hungry yet repelled by food, Weil wrote: "Our greatest affliction is
that looking and eating are two different operations. Eternal
beatitude is a state where to look is to eat."


"The Alien is in my eyes. He's flooding my eyes. He's completely
penetrating me, every bit of me in my eyes.


He's in my eyes, he's spreading into my brain. Oh God,


he's in my mind. He's making me feel things in my body that I don't
feel. He's making me feel feelings, sexual


feelings. And he's there. He's everywhere. My body's changing."


David Jacobs, 1988 interview with an Alien Abductee


- from **Aliens & Anorexia**, Semiotexte/Smart Art Press 1999

---

In **Aliens & Anorexia** I am attempting to make contact with the
writer and philosopher Simone Weil. At the moment of her death in
August, 1943, Weil became an Alien, i.e., a legend who transformed
politics into tragic poetry. Not all Alien encounters are hostile and
dispassionate invasions. There are others who see the Aliens as their
friends. Aliens encounters, like narrative, happen essentially in
realtime. In order to make contact with the Aliens, it is necessary to
carve out little pieces of yourself to let the Aliens come in.


In Paris, the librarian Florence de Lussy is editing Weil's
**Collected Works** for Gallimard. Weil's been dead for more than
fifty years. The project's overdue. The edition will contain eleven
volumes, and yet hardly any of what Weil wrote was published in her
own lifetime. Because she was an amateur philosopher, teaching
philosophy in French girls' lycees until 1941 when Jews were banned
from working for the government, Weil's writing has a narrative
quality mostly absent from the philosophy of her own time. She wrote
articles for the leftist press, reports, position papers and
communiques during her years as a trade union activist. Concurrently,
and in the years following her disillusion with the trade union
movement, she wrote notebooks and voluminous letters to her friends
and colleagues. In solidarity with the dispossession of the workers
who her labor colleagues claimed to represent, Weil sought out the
experience of dispossession in the person that she knew the best,
herself. "If the 'I' is the only thing we truly own, we must
destroy it," she wrote in **Gravity and Grace**. "Use the 'I' to
break down 'I'." She was despicable; according to Bataille,
"odious, immoral ... a dirty hook-nosed Jew." Had anyone taken her
seriously enough to prompt her to write professionally for
publication, her work would not have happened. She was writing to find
out what she thought.


"The body is a lever for salvation," Weil wrote in her notebook in
New York. "But in what way? What is the right way to use it?"


Simone Weil was a performative philosopher. Because her texts are
really notebook writings, there isn't ever any subject that's apart
from her. Which is not to say she's writing "memoir" or
"autobiography." Channeling her subjects through her person, Weil
does what writers do. She is constructing a narrative in
realtime---arriving at a state of openness, witnessed by her audience,
the reader---in which thoughts fly in and out according to who's
listening. In Weil's philosophy, just like in narrative or phone sex,
it's not the story that we're really hearing, it is the fact and act
of telling it. Her thought approaches narrative---an emotional
transparency that occurs when someone else is listening to you.



# Rachel Levitsky: On Narrativity



## A. Alphabets 

**Why?** Because I love to quote myself. Because I have a
fantasy of saying it all. Because of the dense foundation. Because it
is that difficult to imagine it's a girl. Because, I want to write a
beautiful sentence. (Violet Leduc) Because, A fine rain was filling
him with hope and despair. (ibid) Because there is so much to explain
when you are not, say, Stanley Kubrick, like why the back of the naked
torso (female) is relevant to the subject matter. Because I should
have written of the degradation of an aging pussy before Richard Hell
did. Because the world needs to be created and stated over and over
again if one is a woman. Because some of my favorite women writers
feel they must write as men because it is impossible for them to write
action as a woman. (See Christina Peri Rossi; Iris Murdoch told a
college class in which sat Marcella Durand, that writing as a man was
easier.) Because I am afraid a penis will be placed in my absences
when what I need is a dildo, in other words I need plastic, rubber,
elasticity, strength, reliability, trust, safety. In other words to my
dismay, my absences, my blanks, my ambiguities are most comfortable to
men, meaning, they will define them, but it is women that I want.

## B. Bully 

Because I'm a poet I will tell you this is about narrativity
and I hope you will believe me. Because it is narrative and I am a
poet I expect you to believe me. I got together with Judy the Pothead
DumDum. She didn't ask me about my writing or say that I looked good.
Trashy but good. She didn't say it, so I am saying it. I wasn't
drawing a cat, dog, house. I was scribbling. I didn't make sense to
you or to myself. I was being messy which was a clear expression. I
want you to notice me but don't expect you to. I didn't wear
underpants and it wasn't a bad dream. My shirt is both dirty and
stained, just what you'd like to accuse me of. My lips taste good and
my pits stink. You like the smell of my hair but its just Vidal
Sassoon, bought cheap at the five and dime, no, that'd be Rite Aid,
everything that is anything these days is everywhere. I am practically
nowhere. I am trying to remember to stay off the drugs most times I
forget why. My ends are splitting and I can't afford the expensive
haircuts and don't trust the lady at the five and dime. My hairs true
color reforms from the root. You'd prefer to be fooled. Call me cat,
dog, house frau in a light blue frock. I can do it for a moment and my
thin lips rock and roll in almost any shade, though the counter boy'd
have me believe one works better than another. I haven't got a date
or room on my card for dinner. Martinis are expensive. I make them at
home like Laura Dern's mother in Wild at Heart. I take other women's
misfortune as a warning. She's a wizened cat so waits, knowing Ill
move first and fall on my reputedly pretty face. I made the point that
the pronouns don't matter but watch how they do, in vitro, embryo,
room with a view. All dogs are as faithful as me. I've a new middle
name, its hard to be ethical. Watch the one who emits so much, so much
love, s/he will betray you most stunningly or most poorly. Jade
Netanya looks up from the middle of the photo, grief stricken, the
dead guy wielding the eight-inch hammer divinely inscribed with the
ineffable name of god was her fiance, though she's a lesbian. The
rabbi, the unbalanced baal shuva, Jade, my sister, fellow poets. She
was waiting for Ms. Perfection/Beatific Amor but No One likes to be
alone. Its like being diabetic which uninterceded leads to blindness
and amputations. Nowadays in more adults and poor fat children. He was
a menace to the children. The complaining neighbors came to feel
guilty as Jews will, they didn't invite him over enough to dinner.
Instead, they made a lovely funeral. About me. As a child I was often
having others take off their pants and squat. Expunge or include? A?
or P?

## C. Cut me ups 

I think it's Nicole Brossard who said, surely among
others, that in poetry the character is always far away, whereas in
prose there are characters more alive than herself. Let me look for
it, aha, here it is, page 27, in "She Would Be The First Sentence of
My Novel." The characters, they will talk and argue among themselves,
they will disintegrate and reappear, they will separate and unite.
They will explain, as Yaya and Grace do constantly, how it is that
they both care to be lovely and don't give a damn about happiness or
what you think of them, how they understand that the monstrous is the
more potent state, and embrace it, but politically and for survival,
they must cover it up constantly. Grace, who primps like a lady, is as
disturbing as Yaya, who emits the foulness of hell on earth, when she
(Grace) walks into a room. The lookers on are confused by their own
discomfort. The obvious grotesque (Yaya) is easier to ignore. Men
claim ugliness for themselves, it is free, without cost, abandonment.
It is theirs, they own it, they saddle us with the cost of beauty. I
saw a woman who'd been freed from her cancerous chin, now an absence
covered by scarred and taut skin. Of course class, capitalism, if she
had been rich . . . The next day there was another, a s/he, a
distortion. I fell in love. And today, there was another, my cheating
heart. A beautiful creature in a convex mirror, reading **The
Adventures of Buffy the Vampire Slayer**. In my dreams I am another,
idealized, the one with whom I am in love. On the train, I am a
monster, I hold onto the hope that you will not turn away. I wait for
the novel in which I am not a ghost. The theory gave so much
hope---those French (what is it about the French?), the Lesbian Body
(bloody), De Beauvoir's the potent female finger on the button
(machine). Feminine plural, a sex that isn't one, alter egos, as
drag, Dred, Queer Confab, Bound. I began to believe I was beautiful on
the inside. Another woman became a mother. Another lesbian a wife. At
the Lesbian bar a screech, a piercing cry on the heals of a bitter
complaint. Forty pounds heavier, those horrifying saggy tits, from the
mouths of babes, the new lover of a good friend's ex-lover. Political
moment? Nowhere to be found. At the mall, at the Body Shop you may
send postcards to senators. I escape to Coney Island, as yet
mall-less. Here I can feel this---we are in the interim, the
momentless, bearing the interminable wait for the next moment. When
the next time comes, I will still be writing the Lesbian body, forty
pounds heavier, with sagging tits.

 

 



# Pamela Lu: my narrative



 

**First there was this thing**, this experience, that I felt myself having
at last. I had felt the experience coming on for some time, without
knowing quite what it was about to be, what it might resemble, or when
exactly it might arrive. Perhaps I had read about it once, glimpsed a
description of it catching a character, a familiar protagonist, a
stand-in, in its sure, capable hands. There was the possibility that
it might miss me entirely as I loped along the wrong side of the
alley, ordered the wrong label of scotch from the wrong west-end
saloon. A possibility that I might lift my eyes just in time to watch
it happen to my neighbor instead and, all too late, jump to my feet to
exclaim, "Hey, that's my horse! Well, maybe not my horse exactly,
but absolutely its blood relation!" To which the experience would
reply, tenderly and oh so Jamesian, "Not this time, not you. Maybe
next year, to the soul you will have become if only you had learned to
abandon the regret of your current, expiring ghost ..."

Then I was sure that it had happened, not merely to a surrogate, but
to me personally, that I had not only jumped into its hands but
entered it in total, inhabiting its limits with the whole of my being.
The unanswerable question of it flogged me with the rapture of body
and soul. I called myself into existence by my proper name, and
watched my former life flow past in parallel streams, burbling and
breaking up into little tearful books. I demanded unambiguous signs of
my entry into the actual world. And this all happened in the middle of
time, while I or some other writer was fast asleep, dreaming up
masterpieces that were bound to be forgotten. While I was too busy
becoming the character who would have become me in an ideal life,
friends carried on in my absence. I felt the need to track the
movements of my friends, to check in periodically and make sure no one
had died or disappeared. Usually they could all be accounted for,
milling about in packs around the pool table, as an unidentified
narrator slipped through their midst like a generous thief, strewing
stolen, anonymous pears left and right.

In the slow crush of time, characters aged, my friends grew older, and
the unthinkable happened to people. I did not, however, in the moment
in which I was destined to live, understand any of this. I had been
impressed by the nature of fate and outcome in E.M. Forster novels --
how, in the absence of divine intervention, the hand of fate was given
over to mortals who schemed compulsively, recklessly, and blindly to
bring about often unfortunate results, perhaps even a tragedy. There
were ambitious do-gooders whose ambitions caused more harm than good,
prejudiced Victorians who lashed out politely and brutally at the
weak, colonial subjects who pleased their masters by losing out again
and again. The characters lived; they brought life down upon
themselves; they wrestled with causality and causality won. Is that
why I'm always confusing causality with casualty?

A friend from school once observed that fiction students as a group
seemed bigger and physically stronger than their poet counterparts.
How much would this statement suggest a three-ring bout in the
writers' circle, with scrappy but effete sonneteers grappling at the
well-muscled backs of market scriveners? What kind of over-dense
poetic whimsy could tickle the plodding narrative to unclog its drain
to the real story? This story was so real it was almost untellable;
one would have had to be already dead, installed in some paradise or
afterlife, in order to understand it completely. The neutron star of
its as yet undiscovered language weighed the earth down in orbit,
while sending out regular pulsations of superhot, ecstatic light which
caused even fatalists to see. And yet the parameters of the story
demanded the most outrageous courage of those who would experience it:
biblionauts who would sail paper spaceships deep into the fiery
outskirts of existence and return, defenseless, with a strange,
material testimony. Was this, after all, the true knowledge and danger
that awaited our fumbling lives?

 



# Nicole Markotic: Narrotics: New Narrative and the Prose Poem





**I am interested** in a dialogue about "new" narrative, which is
perhaps not so much *new*, as newly theorized. Many prose writers do
not consider themselves fiction writers, yet at the same time are not
really part of on-going poetics discussions which, for the most part,
do not focus on narrative. Although I also write prose fiction, I
consider my prose poetry and other alternative, interdisciplinary, and
innovative sentences to be a neoteric prose that both challenges and
expands language boundaries.

For me, the prose poem is a poetic strategy embedded within the
structure of narrative, and a feminist response to patriarchal
language and forms. By embracing both prose syntax and poetic
disruptions, the prose poem defies conventional linear grammar and
refuses to satisfy my desires for either poetry or story. My desire is
for so much more than causal, linear, rational and persuasive
normative sentences. In my novel and in my poetry, I try to live
between the promise of narrative and the fulfillment of the habit of
fiction.

By expropriating two distinct genres while presenting a form of
writing that is seen to consist of both, prose poetry presents itself
as hybrid writing; a hybrid that I explore as crossing between the
desire to exceed formal considerations, and the narrational insistence
surrounding such considerations. In my prose poems, I try to embrace
the problematic of poetry that "looks" like ordinary prose
narrative, yet invites disjunctive readings which may extend beyond
traditional poetic forms and conventional conceptions of narrative. My
pieces "fail" as poetry--yet continually celebrate the erotic
contradiction such failure narrates.

The prose poem, for me, offers itself as a "genre" that permits and
encourages me to move freely from sentence to line-break to full-stop
to repetition. Without entirely settling on its own definition, the
prose poem rattles my airtight nerves, upsets my crabapple go karts,
insistently and lasciviously rubs my discourse the wrong
way---inventing, always reinventing itself. Its very possibility
denies its own existence. For me, the prose poem remains liminal: not
merely transgressive, but indeterminite, caught in the phoenix act of
disappearing, reappearing as its own *possibility*.

My interest in this form begins at the level of the sentence. What
makes a sentence a line of poetry rather than an excerpt from an essay
or novel? The answer, for me, is the surrounding words and sentences,
the position of those words on the page, the complicated ache of the
forced return at the end of each "line." Ear and eye games, the
playing of interruption and proceed. Not stop-and-go, but
go-and-go-farther. As soon as I take a step towards the horizon, the
horizon reconfigures---itself and me.

What interests me about the sentence as poetic form is that poets who
are *least* interested in representational language are most often the
ones who turn to a grammatical structure which invests heavily in
sentential logic. The use and abuse of the sentence, then, seems to be
the focus of the poem. And because one sentence follows the
next--which offers a visual hypotasis but a semiotic parataxis---the
poem insists on a reading that is far more linear (for lack of a
better word), than is a line-break poem with disparate images stacked
one above the other. The one poetic device designated as prose or
*not* poetry, the sentence, becomes the choice unit of composition for
poets who intrigue me, shock me, paratactically get under my skin.

Within each sentential piece can emerge a plasticity resistant to
notions of purity in either prose *or* poetry. Gertrude Stein chose
the sentence as her basic unit of composition. Her sentences release
readers from the semantic baggage traditionally loaded into narrative
prose as they re-define, distort, conflate, skew, and otherwise render
the sentence pliable and visceral:

> A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle
> and nothing strange in a single hurt color and an
> arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and
> not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The
> difference is spreading. (**Tender Buttons** 9)

Such prose rumbles inside the belly of poetry, or perhaps poetry
shifts awkwardly within the abdomen of prose. Readers, seduced by
sentence structure, discover themselves trespassing an erotics of
prose, transgressing away from familiar and known fiction offerings.

Writers engaging in what Stephen Fredman calls "poets prose,"
struggle to create new ideas from *inside* the conventions that
constitute the either/or structure of the prose poem. This structure
is the chance for prose writers to both follow narrative and to
deviate away from story. For example, Robert Kroetsch, in his poem
"The Sad Phoenician," pursues an elusive and/but dialogue that
generates a bifurcated and pending narrative:

|  and        the Phoenicians gave us the whole works
|  but        what does that matter to a world that ignores
|               them, the Greeks got all the credit of
|               course, because they stole the alphabet
|  and        the girl from Swift Current, she more or less
|               took everything
|  but        the kitchen sink, claiming all my books, my
|               my records, my prints; she moved in with that
|               photographer from Saskatoon, the one who
|               takes those sterling pictures of the wind
|  and        I should sue
|  but        she follows large flocks of birds, I hear,
|               calling my name
|  and        pleading
|  but        why she developed a thing for adverbs, that's
|               too rich for my blood, I want to tell you
|  and

Readers wander through an and/but tug-of-war that is also a narrative
wandering, from the Phoenicians and Greeks to Saskatchewan, to the
very grammar of the telling. It is this *telling* that gets so many
new prose writers into trouble---isnt plot the very basis of novels?
How can one tell a story and avoid fiction? And why do we want to?

Feminist writers must resist and reinvent patriarchal language to make
it our own. We cross a border every time we pick up a pen or turn on
the computer or hum into a tape deck. The border is a visible line on
the page that the prose poem physically outlines. For many women, this
is not simply a gendered border, but one that has been criss-crossed
by social lines such as race or class. Harryette Mullen, in her prose
poetry book, **S*PeRM**K*T**, investigates the connective links
between the social and the linguistic:

| Eat junk, don't shoot. Fast food leaves hunger off the hook.
| Employees must wash
| hands. Bleach your needles, cook the works. Stick it to the frying
| pan, hyped again.
| Another teflon prez. Caught in the fire around midnight, quick and
| dirty biz. Smoked
| in the self-cleaning oven.

Mullen's disconnected sentences can be read to produce meanings that
address subjects ranging from drugs to poverty in contemporary USA.
But the structure of the "narrative" does not create fictional
characters and circumstances to battle these issues; rather, Mullen's
words entice at the same time as they startle reading practices. Word
association and colloquial speech patterns reinvent the chance to
re-enter the text from another crack. This text does not close the
book on the story, it continues to remind that reading is a
socially-coded act, and that a reader's subjectivity is constructed
through how she enters language.

Language enters me, and my sentences struggle against what I know to
be "just" a sentence. I hesitate in doorways and on fences, I plan
my route along edges and cracks in the sidewalk, I pencil in margins
made up of words only words, and then I cross over into blank space.
Not because it is "new" or "white" or "virginal" or any other
dominant appropriative term, but because the blank space is where the
prose poem offers a *visible* margin, a territory (known or not) that
hangs onto the edges of writing, clings to the edges of edges. I get
edgy when I try to read or write a prose poem, anxious, excitable,
downright perplexed. I hang about on the inside of this perplexing
form because it keeps me on my language toes: unsure and insecure,
tip-toeing across whatever lines a poem insists upon.

I "plot" at sentences and subterfuge, dream of a poetry that
withstands ragged-right fashions, yet continues to address narrative
within disjunctive non-lineated prose. I look to the prose poem as
mutation-- by definition unstable, punctuated by eternally reproducing
desires.

I want to carry words to where theyre already going, but not
necessarily to where I think they're carrying me. I strive to enact
an and/but *narrative erotic* that is neither fiction nor poetry, that
invites readers to see beyond seeing and write beyond reading. I veer
away from the end of that prose line, from the punct signifying the
closing ceremony, the final page next to the cover, the certain and
the certified. I question the metaphorical imperative that insists
toes are what we tip on, and grasp instead the reassurance of
instability, embrace the inability to embrace a stable subjectivity,
and echo cheerfully what Kathleen Fraser describes as "fragments of a
wholeness only guessed at" (**Each Next**). My prose poems
want/desire/lust after such guessing contortions.

Ten minus one

She counted but was

not believed. The syllables like a mantra. The answer. Counting in
order to rid herself of numbers, of time. The increments of the
present. The same count. A decimal minus one reminds one never to go
over or to go back. Not a sequence but a repetition like a song. A
petition like a question. Never again. Duchamp as a form of grief. A
diary. A display of the invisible. Of visible decay. The mode here is
eliminative. It is the only mouth she has left.

"Piece of Ass Lost." The necropolis pictured by a dead poet in
Ellroy's **Clandestine**. Poet cop. The mouthpiece of fate.
Exploitation as love. Women who don't get older. Women as men. It
doesn't matter. The U.S. number one in violent death just past Mexico
and Brazil. First in the First World and the Third. The guardian of
the infested spirit. Someone follows a woman. She is not a muse but a
fate. She talks too much.. They drink together.They eat. Is she one of
many or a singular masterpiece. Impossible to follow him down that
street. The action is complete to the degree that it is not legible.
Or transferable to another medium. It is not unfinished but undone.
Not the crime but the gun. The piece of string with which you hope to
find yourself. Missing. She was missing her head. What we have is a
reconstruction.

Diana watches herself on TV. She wanders absently around the house.
She is not dead. She is an artist. The interview reveals everything
she hopes for. There is a queen and a corpse. She finds her cigarettes
and begins to smoke. She is seventy. Voluptuous as parchment. Thickly
written. She takes into herself a sense of death. She lets it out.

She wonders how to preserve access without giving into a deadened
sense of hierarchical exclusion. Now that authority has been shown to
be the shuck it is. To provide a method for reading, to alter the
activity of reading itself. In retrospect or in the sense that it had
already taken place. She read the scene before the crime. Or we
wouldn't be having this conversation. His ambition is naked,
mechanical. He also wants to read.

The vaginal scroll

She performs (Schneeman)

Memorably laid out

Source or origin

Like a physical note

Of itself sufficient

Opened like the book

She wrote

The reconstruction is sloppy. Bad. Not convincing. Not made to be so.
Black velvet lines the unseen back of the door. To soften the blow.
Her character pokes through her performance like bones through flesh.
Judy. Judith. She loves him but he loves her double. Her twin. Who is
convincing. A con, snare or fox. A pest. He likes the angularity. The
bending back. But he falls during the kiss. He is injured. "I hate
this" she says. He doesn't miss her then.

The scroll unwinding and the performer

Takes over removing

Her shroud her look

Distracted in the picture

She takes off

Her glasses her theatricality

Will be attacked in place of her person

He argues her down

Her desire is unknown

Impossible to predict its hold on him. "... a diagram of the cruel
geometries of desire." The reviews are ambivalent. The scriptedness
of their exchanges are painful to him. Her double jumps into the bay.
The actor after. Also his double. Later on a sound stage wet
close-ups. The real actors. His strained face dazed with obsession.
The paleness of her hair, dark dress spread out but clinging also. Her
limpness in his arms. He stares down at her, climbing imaginary steps
out of the sea. Her high heels in silhouette. The twist of her waist
is displayed to him, to us.

## 1

Madeleine is weak but alive. Unconscious. He takes her to his
apartment on Russian Hill. He kicks open the bedroom door, placing her
carefully on his bed. He first takes off her shoes. She stirs but
doesn't wake. He holds her in a sitting position, unzipping her dress
in the back. Pale wide shoulders, wet slip, brassier. He pulls her
dress and slip over her head. He becomes aware that her breasts are
against him. Nipples like buttons. He works quickly against her
waking. Unfastens garters. Peels off stockings. He reaches around her
waist and has some trouble with clips. He begins to breathe hard but
quietly. Her head falls back. Her neck is long and white. His hands
are dark against her skin. He is careful with his hands like a
surgeon. He draws the blanket over her. Even in this drowned sleep
there is a defensiveness to the set of her features. He stares only
briefly. His audience, himself, is aware of the contrivance of his
composure. But is unaware that her unconsciousness is an act. He knows
only in retrospect. Perhaps she knows that he is both protector and
killer. She seems to be in control. Also looking back. But she is out
of her depth.

The Bride does not refuse

this stripping by the

bachelors, even

accepts it since she

furnishes the love gasoline

and goes so far as to help

towards complete nudity

by developing in a

sparkling fashion

Her intense desire for orgasm clings to her like his red silk robe.
When she runs she knows he will go where she goes. She has tricked him
but at too great a cost. She sees this as a job. He sees it as rescue
and sex. But she can't be saved from the danger of being false. She
can't be had. The hopelessness skews their perception. Heightens
their senses.

The artist likes to see the woman go too far. The woman likes it too.
She manages the twists with some virtuosity. She puts herself beyond
her skill. The character changes in desperation but is unable, each
time, to survive. Her eyes in multiple shots. His eye in the credits.
Jimmie. A simple expedient but effective. Death to itself. And Kim.
The actor is left.

To be disassembled

Exit stage right

And another rescue

Marooned on a penal colony in space

She remembers his memory

His voice a slurred machine

"My nakedness creates you," he says (dead)

She brings up the interface

Turns it on

A golem. Like herself. Skin like flesh only not in her mind. Inside
the memory, the wetware an obscene cream as if robots ran on semen.
She turns to him. In pieces. In a kind of mechanical pain. He carries
in him the mothers who didn't survive. It is evident in his soft
address. He is her confidant. Her history. She confides. They confer
in a jacked-in version of love. His love is wired in. They know things
together that otherwise only she knows. "It's better than sex," she
says. He says " No, it's not."

Kienholz by definition

The bionic man

"We can rebuild him"

Not a faceless door

But organ donor

Plugged in

What happened to him

If she is Death in Orphee

He is her driver

An assisted death. They would be lovers in another life. She prefers
his later more vicious fiction but he hasn't grown into it yet. Their
times are not synced.

# Lisa Robertson: For Soft Architects



 

Lucite

(a didactic)

(because the present is not articulate)

Sit us on Lucite gently and we will tell you how knowledge came to us.

First the dull mud softened resulting in putrefaction, lust and

intelligence, pearl globs, jeweled stuff like ferrets, little theatres
of

mica, a purse containing all the evil smells of daily life. Then just
the

one vowel, iterate and buttressed and expiring; leaning, embracing,
gazing.

It devised with our claw identity for the sake of food. Selves, it
says,

feeding us, I adore you, you know. Like a boy blowing from a tree, we

decided, we were paid, we were free. We incessantly prepared for the

future. On the title page, two angels blowing on the trumpets of fame
held

up a globe decorated with three fleur-de-lys and topped with a crown.
We

learned habits and tricks; we faked happiness and relief. We were a
single

grin with lips pasted back. We said we saw Europes of hallucination,
fatty

broths sprinkled with deer, stenciled eagles, serpents and lurid rags.
That

was a format of saying, a frayed ligature. We were fading into the
presence

or absence of food, of sleep, of doubt.

Enough of the least. Doubt wants no space. Sincerity takes too long in
an

aggressive emergency. The present is not articulate. Also we feel a
sense

of duality. We wear out the art. We start to modify our vocables--
flick,

pour, dribble estrangement's sex. Since it is we who are one, and we
who

are scattered. We're this pair or more that can't absorb one another
in a

meaning effect. We feel palpitated by daylight and its deliberate
plants. A

description makes us. Among all these ejaculations and judgements we
feel

its elsewhere sculpt our body.

We would be walking down the street in the poetrycity. Gauze would be

everywhere. The day would be big, halting, gracious, revocable, cheap.
We'd

be the she-dandies in incredibly voluptuous jackets ribboning back
from our

waists, totally lined in pink pure silk, also in pure humming, and
we'd be

heading through the buildings with knowledge---that is, ephemeral

knowledge, like leafage or sleeves or pigment. The streets are salons
that

receive abundantly our description. The soft buildings are charming.
And

our manners are software. We feel sartorial joy. We'd be at the river

watching the fat water lap the blonde built part, loving temporal

improprieties, the bright trash floating in slow liberation. We'd be

applying our make-up at noon by the river, leaning on the balustrade,

thinking about a little shun, a little fight, a little sofa. We'd be

thinking about hinges. We'd feel for our pen. Something might seduce
us. A

likeness. Samesame pouring through it.

Knowledge comes to us.

 

 



# Camille Roy: Monstrous



 

**One of the forms** of narrative I write is software. Its lucrative.
About four years ago I used stock options to buy a house right around
the corner plus one block from one of the worst housing projects in
San Francisco. A couple thousand people live there. It gives my
neighborhood the highest child hunger rate in the city. Our first
night in the house someone got murdered, just before midnight . It was
a block a way but the shot sounded like it was in our back yard. One
shot, a pause, then another. Purposeful. Somehow I knew it was
intended to kill, and not just a couple of kids shooting at the moon.
Plus the neighbor told us hed had his car stolen 3 times.

Impenetrable poverty plus dumb fuck rules, class and race segregation:
Id moved into the only San Francisco neighborhood that duplicated on a
smaller scale what I grew up with. It annoyed me.

Locality, forever. *Skewed*. Something huge gets mutilated as it
slides through a stuffy tube. Were on the beach very far to the west,
watching what pops out. It contains all of American culture. I came
here so tightly wound. Born on 43rd street south side Chicago & havent
been back since I left the hospital.

From my dining room window, at the rear of the house, the project
looks strangely vacant. There just never seem to be many people
around. The buildings proceed down the hill towards the old industrial
port like giant shabby steps, but there is never anyone on the racks
of balconies. Ive rarely driven through it. Structurally, its sort of
a dead-end place, the way its laid out, like a suburban subdivision:
streets point into it, then twist up like spaghetti. The few
drive-through streets are dotted with dealers scoping out the passing
cars. Im just talking about the roads.

When I first moved in I often found myself dreamily staring out the
dining room window. I wanted to check out one of those balconies. The
view would be amazing, they practically hang over the bay. Developers
have been salivating over that piece of land for years. Nowadaze they
are nibbling at the edges of the project, building expensive live work
lofts for software designers on adjoining vacant industrial land. Its
weird. Different economic classes get spliced together via crimes. The
mode of interaction being criminal. So one day I mentioned to a friend
of mine that I didnt get it, how did dealers get kids to work for
them---playing courier, or delivery boy. What would a dealer have on a
kid? Why get involved with some jacked-up, scary asshole? I felt like
an idiot as soon as the words left my mouth. Patiently, step by step,
my friend explained how it was done, until I could have done it
myself, as obviously he had. All I had to do was ask. Knowledge. The
getting & taking and the tearing up. Did I want to go there?

Of course I did. One day I walked in, took a place on the balcony next
to all of my friends & drank their salty water. I listened to the
radio. I watched as a crack lady ran down the street behind a white
dog. Then the dog was scratching at the door. When I woke up that
sound was the shade, bumping against the window frame. And I was
thinking, as I am always doing and my thinking told me this: *This is
what I want. Its inside my system of attractions. Im penetrated by the
present and its always the same: chronic anger. Awful but refreshing*.

From up here, it is all visible. From down below, also. Radiant
contradiction. Eyeballs: the severely vivid mechanism. Finally what is
seen is not a target but just circumference, expanding. Highlights
scatter across the field.

I walked into the projects a couple of weeks ago. Its right around the
corner, why not just walk? It was a friends birthday. She told me
where she lived, but it wasnt easy to find. The apartments didnt have
numbers on them, you had to just know. I asked a bunch of people. Kids
were running everywhere. How come I hadnt seen them from my back
window? I look whiter than usual, I thought, looking at my hand. Up
here and not even shopping, that made me odd. People looked at me
skeptically. I felt skeptical about myself, but slick, as in greased.
I wanted to fall off my little ledge. Bored with what had gotten
dished up as myself. The backwash of swallowing it. That nausea.

The balcony was great. I hung with my friends and listened to the
radio. They played that song I like, the one about money. Later we
went out to eat birthday steaks.

California is shallow. Thats true. Though it thrills me that I can
walk across the city without getting beat up for crossing some
invisible dividing line of racial turf. Of course I could get beat up
for something else. *Im so easy to please.* Its the instability at the
heart which is to say the heartlessness of just washing away faster.

Im supposed to write about narrativity but these problems of locality
are where I get started. For me writing grinds itself into whats
familiar yet unbearable. Add mobility to that and, voila, narrative.
Disjunction is the formal consequence of this ripping and tearing, and
its packed with information, almost to the point of being insensible.

The streets I walk measure me. They measure you too, through
mechanisms both criminal and friendly. Including that knowledge is a
kind of spectacular innocence---the moment of saturation feels
dazzling, but there is probably no point. Still I love it, formally
and erotically and intimately. Its all about nested structures. I
entrust my twisted little pieces to the warm nest of the sick social
body, and I feel our bond. It nourishes me.

To theorize my point of view, to pursue critical formalism as a ritual
and as a grasp for power, let me put it this way. Narrative provides
context so that the rupturing of identity is recognizable. I think we
are impossible beings. We ruthlessly evade scrutiny, yet recognition
is the beginning of transformative emotion. Its a feeding process. You
dont know if youre creating a monster.

As a narrative writer I improvise recognition. Its like a location
from which mutant beings emerge. This feels true, in life they never
stop emerging. Look---they even swarm through this text. I allow it
because Im terrified and seduced. To encounter them via narrative is
to formalize a moment of surrender.

Series, SUNY Buffalo.)



# Leslie Scalapino: Narrating



**I just write,** without advance plan as to a plot or form the writing
driven by a wind of my being in some urgency at the time. Each work
I've done has been written in that way. Each is different. The next
time I'll write dependent on what's occurring then. Here I'll say
something about Defoe (Sun & Moon, 1995) since of my prose it was the
hardest on me (in a state of extremity) and required the greatest
extension. 'Narrating' is for me:

Inextricably related not simply because events 'are related', but
because the relation intrinsically is oneself. The phenomenal world of
nature is inseparable from one's 'conception' (visual and tactile)
and also does not come from oneself. One is one's relation to the
rose disc-cloud on the desert as to social occurrence, such as
people's minute nuances or war:

"disc floating on the desert, with cattle that come to the edge of
the blue water and the white desert not coming from it.

One has to agree with them or is not there which in society can not
push out from themselves the red soft hanging disc. that is separate.

misery in having to be in agreement with them giving up being there
though one can't do that."

One can not be as social definition, yet that exists. That social
relation is inherent conflict as oneself in which one cannot exist or
be 'causes' the syntax to be a 'place'. Surfaces collapse on each
other, existing together as plates in paragraphs, clarity only
possible by inclusion of, or being, the conflict. Conflict is the
writing's shape configured and is attention in space.

Sleeping dreams are 'compared' to the literal "day"-as-surface as
if both day and dreams were surfaces as thin discs and placed
side-by-side the ego not in either of these but there also:

"One sees oneself as simply a shallow behavior that is thin. and so
one is free. And then turned inside so that one's dreams are sent
into one from the day, as they are it. So there is no REM. People rest
in the thin area. One laughs frisky. love in behavior is there, in
reverse. That is the street, the way it is seen."

Also fictional events and real events (the Gulf War) are placed
side-by-side regardless of their size:

"An object connotes by a prior connection or culture.

Where the object loses, or begins, its connotative existence is to be
just then non-connotative. (To see its edge...) would place the piece
at the point of dissolving. forming as an object and socially. which
is nothing. An object's form isn't anything as that. So it's the
point of the form and the conceptual meaning separating. (or rather,
being the same)...Trying to get to or to see where actions separate
from their social existence which is what they are that is their
connotative being, so seeing an action without that."

Action is seen 'without' itself in the sense that action (that which
is enacted, as physical movement) is 'other than' writing, the one
can not be the other they (both) are also phenomena as conflict, thin
discs that impinge on each other:

"Action collapses on itself and is compressed, in that it is
description of itself. It is thus in the present-time, still and calm.

It does not diverge from itself, supposedly. That's a conception
which people already know. Therefore speaking enables one to see the
diverging or separation that is this present. These actions occur as
if to make the pupil of an eye (some other's) dilate, and be held
open. The present takes place as 'some other.'

Life is dilated.

It does not diverge because description cannot be separate. as it is
of itself."

Defoe, the writer, created fictional characters who were supposedly
real giving documentary accounts. They were to be imagined as
entities, which had no reality. Paragraphs are plates of actions which
are not single and do not begin or end there in order for there to be
reflection (as the text) throughout everywhere that is not mirroring
of authority as authority is not (is not in) any single one of those
actions:

"To name it will be merely caught again in their authority as they
will recognize that as themselves and will be in their trap again.

If there is no area between his dreams and waking life, there is no
identifying with anyone.

Walk through stream of hot metal bumpers of cars that then move like
plates shifting. Mass of plates and she's veering in it. On tin tail
of motorbike of yellow teeth thrashing in neck. He's ahead then. On
it again thrashing neck. The bike skidding and swaying in narrow
channel amidst bumpers. It bucks forward. Neck bike veering and
bucking out on the vast tin sheet. the sunlight is reflecting off. He
wriggles free, lunging. The motorbike lunges forward. Crashes into
car's side in the mass. Slippery blood on his head neck slashing.
She's slashed hard slamming into car's side. Rider on foot then,
veering and is way ahead then out on stalled mass.

Seeing him out on the vast reflected expanse."

Prior sight we see things before they occur: whatever dream occurs,
that's waking life. Perception does occur in people (or 'in'
something happening) what is it?

"Perception occurs before the context it is not in a setting.

Without seeing it as it was going on while seeing it, really. The man
in being authority is the process of down fawning on the feet of the
other man while this is merely an image a negative that is imposed on
it. Like an angel.

Is it that seeing into the future as what's going to happen to people
it then just is that. It occurs. Isn't deflected. That isn't
continual change which is aware as we are in it.

We can see it in ourselves. that's why it's aware.

People see that later. Not when they're young. it's separate from
what's actually there which is to be seen directly. has to be.

There is no 'inner reality' to the destruction that this person is
creating for themselves from within, which is seen from the outside by
others.

So suffering is in oneself, and has no 'inner reality'."

The relation of creating a spatial shape as the writing to changing
what occurs (a friend dying from leukemia was having a bone marrow
transplant at the same time as the bombing of Iraq the illusion that
one could avert and change this reality while it's occurring in the
mind relation that's the writing yet the friend died and the bombing
destroyed) is an impossible terrain/conflict. The illusion itself took
one apart. It's an illusion that is bathos, like jump-starting a car.
There is nothing commensurate. Fictional jump-starts:

Real boys (and others) starving in the Sudanese desert. One is in or
has the dreams of one's fictional characters to make a particular
surface. "There is no resemblance between the boys and the boys in
the desert, that's forward in time supposedly. really, as it has
reality in itself and is separate from this. One non-reality against
others in oneself, it is seen between them. as oneself is simply that.

It isn't changed when it gets to this. Or by it later.

Dreams are excluded from this, which occur. That's convenient because
I can't remember them. dreamed one which met this red (actual) sunset
that just occurred.

This isn't it. Flattened to my inherent nature. I just woke up. The
man who was the driver deserted by the boys who don't resemble them
on the desert, has a dream:

Venus was hanging above the red smear, which I didn't see in it. The
neighbors with whom had formerly been at war for many years agreed to
smuggle oil to them.

It doesn't resemble them and can be reproduced and only seen in
reading as lovely isn't the market. Seen as lovely it therefore
isn't the market."

In writing: "The seeing is the event, rather than arising from its
occurrence." And: "People's experience lags behind the time
they're in." In other words, Defoe is trying to find the relation
between seeing (apprehension) and occurrence (events occur
'outside'). There is a relation one makes:

"Make writing that forms before motions.

As when I was in a rage, it formed first I'd forgotten it so the
anger occurred, I was in misery. Walking was at base and therefore
observation occurs.

Not observation occurring about it after.

Fictions are so simple that no observation occurs after.

So the fiction occurs first.

Defoe occurs first and so has no validity. It's not bathos and is
only distorted to be first or as being that.

So there's no Garden of Eden. There's not authority at all, that's
to be at base.

Walking occurs first and observation is not derived from it.

I want to still observation first. I started to walk one time with no
writhing and didn't remember beginning walking. I had nothing to
writhe about. There isn't a start of that, that's separated from
walking.

One can eliminate power in oneself by not eliciting placating. Memory
of what hasn't been seen before. So fiction (I mean all
conceptualizing) occurs where the real event isn't isn't seen, it's
eliminated, but is occurring or has. Openly doesn't resemble it.

There's present-time first. That's what fiction is, when it is
entirely stilled. It doesn't resemble the event."

Fictionalizing drives the mind-terrain into a state of separation.
There the dream abuts itself. A real event (such as here an anti-war
demonstration) also abuts itself only:

"The dream I had is closer to being because it abuts it then. before
it's occurred. This is in the present. The blossoms on the plum trees
opened. On some. Birds sit, and fly amongst branches of bare trees. It
has no reverse side, and is thin.

Birds skim low by me.

Wall of police swinging their clubs sweep forward. young punks with
tattoos emerge from the crowd, turning the cop car over and burning
it. They receive beatings.

...A memory as just a thin disc, as it is seen that way. There is no
event.

Warm, the birds stirring and flying. I had a memory of being on an
empty street in San Diego near-by the ocean; just that. that as a disc
because it became so stagnant it seemed it was going to collapse, and
be still. it flapped. my mind had become so tired its resistance was
going. The mind being weary as clarifying in itself.

... 'false joy' because they're lying to us. but inside it is not
their 'false joy.' It could be one's own, that is a thought. which
in itself is joy which bangs against it. The dark cattle stood earlier
with the disc of moon on the other side of them why they were dark;
when the sun was on the side (of them) on which they were dark.

That is in memory as the actual event.

The chest in one is struggling in constriction of joke. Trash. The air
cannot get into the rib cage. The thought of a bicyclist comes up
which is a memory and therefore separated from one, who is small. That
was him and so flattened shooting ahead. His back, that makes one
laugh constricted inside so that it's him.

So the flapping swans here so they're the same as the sky simply
flying is that (in time), before.

The entire day completely dilated is flapping in one's recesses so it
is behind in the back of one. Stagnant in that sense, as it's
flapping and then narrowing it in front though it's still the day.

It's the day in a sense, narrowed to a thin disc in front in which
the entire dilated day behind in the recesses of oneself bangs
shuttering on it. The day collapses in that sense when that's slowed
and interminable.

One rests.

One just sees from one's social group perspective say and then the
huge bright day is dilated flapping with that; so it's involuntarily
let go as it's large and while hitting the recesses in front of one
in the present, remains there shuttering."

Comic book style, the apprehension occurs via "the other" who has a
hole (or eye) in her side, everything seen alongside and flattened.
The visual slots or frames of the comic book (only conceptually
implied) can include all layers and perspectives at once, horizontal
and vertical. The Other is in love with James Dean who in death is
turned into a deer. She pursues the deer to rescue James Dean as the
black rain falls. She's traveling through refugees dying from blood
blisters on the roads. Her own blood blister is gently lanced by a
soldier who's driving the jeep.

The incommensurable relation between outside-action (in the world) and
interior-action mind phenomena is overtly the subject. The shape the
writing takes is related to use of fictional and
autobiographical/historical event (such as the bombing of Iraq) at the
time it's occurring. The time it's occurring the paragraph-plates
are real-time moment of exterior event brought into compressed
relation of interior occurrence/horizon together and always separated.
The intention is that fictional illusion be at the moment of real-time
to: implode it as real-time action.

These are illusions in the practical sense of being 'only' writing
(writing has no relation to present or historical reality it has no
reality, is it as well, being mind phenomena. So the 'ordinary'
small action is [to be] as much 'reality' as events that are
devastating). I am trying to divest hierarchy-of-actions.
'Hierarchy-of-actions' voids people's occurrences (that is,
individuals' actions are relegated to inconsequential or invisible).
Such hierarchy substitutes 'overview' of
'history'/interpretation/doctrine therefore to divest
'hierarchy-of-actions' is certainly a political act. (In
one's/reader's /viewer's conceptualization then [is the
intention]). What I'm referring to as 'divesting
hierarchy-of-actions' by definition has to be in oneself.

Making illusions and noticing them makes them so overt that they
'become' bathos. (I don't regard that as "alienation," however.)
Fundamentally anarchism (viewing that as being observation itself) is
necessitated. Besides **Defoe**, my other prose works (crossed with
being poetry) are: **The Return of Painting**, **The Pearl, and
Orion/A Trilogy** (reprinted by Talisman, 1997) and **The Front
Matter, Dead Souls** (Wesleyan, 1996). Also **Orchid Jetsam** (in
manuscript) and **R-hu** (forthcoming Atelos Press).

 



# Gail Scott: Bottoms Up




**Montreal, Quebec**: I return to the site of an old novel. This will
not always be a street of failure, even if still playing the former
glamour of the seedy. French-language covers of country music are
playing on the radio. Men (sit) alone at tables. One with haggard
bearded face. His lower jaw (is) toothless. Teeth in dreams = sex. The
low façades opposite parading peeling tin cornices. An air of
stagnation possibly verging on cliché. I take some verbs out; then put
them in again.

It is the hottest summer ever. Meteorologists are, with divine
hindsight, admitting global warming. To escape the heat, I go to a
dark afternoon theatre. Where a sassy high school troupes performing
Büchners **Wozeck**. The adolescents sweet songs juxtaposed on the
gloom and violence under, somehow dissolving earlier-decade
interpretations foregrounding worn-out existential despair. Crossing a
parking lot behind a smoked meat shop, I am thinking a story, to avoid
eternally returning (to keep it moving), might be structured thus: an
"older" woman writer circulates at a "fringe" theatre festival of
young artists. She has lost her love. Feels discombobulated. Nothing.
She skirts the crowd asking several 20-year-olds: anything good? She
will then string a humiliated (but raunchy) love tale together,
interlaying bits of youthful sweetness and anger, representing to her
in her present state of emptiness, a more contemporaneously rapid
conflation of beginnings and endings. A word about narrative:

At another table, a man shakes his purple-shirted shoulders in the hot
bar air. To "Caught With Your Pants Down." Drinking straight
tequila. The same table where X and I sat. Discussing why our favorite
writers of new and experimental fiction are not rich and famous. "Too
abject," we say. In a bag at our feet, some cheaply extravagant
dollhouse boudoir furniture purchased for her little son. From the
store with the saggy awning opposite. Leaving, we forget it. Outside
another man passing. With several teeth missing. Teeth = action. But
why the narrator (the woman) endlessly remarking. Such toothless
ghosts of subjects. Among dozens of better-furbished faces. Is her
"local" constructed out of some kind of distancing or bias?* Or
"mere" projection of loves losses? I am thinking **not** abject the
subject. Unless negatively framed. At point of crossing space of
(non)-reception between the work and the world. When site (interior)s
signed minor (inadequate). While exterior=dominant. Yet, intrinsic and
extrinsic syntax are not separate; rapidly they mate. Should I be
happy the lover having sex with no one. If having only virtual sex
with me? I take some verbs out. And put them in again. A word about
the waitress:

Dominatrix in clinging leopard-spotted polyester. Small breasts.
Ponytail. Fortyish. Saying (in québécois): UN verre de vin-maison ne
te ferait pas de mal, one glass of house wine will not ruin the
stomach. I.e. its terrible. For 75 cents more you can have a quarter
liter. Adding: you look en forme, terrific. WE tell each other--in
guise of complimenting--we haven't changed in years. I opting for
the smallest quantity of red vinegar. Now young woman passing by
window. Huge breasts encased in tight halter top. Some little cap over
short hair. And---upper incisors gone. Like the meteorologist, I
admitting only to coincidence of circumstances. Projecting accumulated
lack on unsuspecting bodies. (Waitress bringing unasked for
quarter-liter). Which bodies, in being thus sentenced, already frozen
in past gesture or alias. While environment drifting elsewhere. As in
that restless white river the lover (much later) wanting to attack
with kayak. Drifting eternally toward full-color horizons. The silver
flashes indicating minor notes of salmon struggling upstream. Sitting
close beside her, I encouragingly declaring such projection, battered
by tergiversation of context, likely best position. For
contemporaneous narrator. Just as lover putting hand under skirt cut
on the bias to flare out attractively at the bottom. And saying she
still wanting something with "us." A story is something---you can
put your teeth into:

But what might happen here? With (soon) a closed sign across the
window. Two blocks down. A polished glass and marble multi-story,
multi-venue, multi-media repertory theatre. Having replaced the
crushed blue façade of the smoky cozy café-cinéma where we used to see
old or experimental European French movies. Built by Québécois Soft
Image inventor Daniel Langlois. Were like that here: always
oscillating between the ultra-modern and the crumbling. The sound
systems so efficient, one feels, listening to the Buena Vista Social
Club, as if in some club in crumbling Havana. Though the octogenarian
musicians having mostly ceased performing on their blockaded island.
Because "nowhere" to go. Until American Ry Cooder choreographing
their (global) return. I am thinking of when Québec liberationists
claiming solidarity with Cuba. Which solidarity currently updated to
meaning "corporate opportunity." At last, the Cubans playing
Carnegie Hall. I am thinking how any narrative, if fronted, marketed
from economically preferential geographical site, avoiding being
troped as exotically remote, a remoteness that must (paradoxically)
scale global walls or languish. I am thinking of Cuban sunsets,
suffused towards evening with a little blood. Of the womans eye
growing humid, sentimental. When, in the movie, the elderly guitarist
exclaiming: "There is nothing like a night of love." To keep it
moving, I take some verbs out and put them in again. A word about
identity:

Now the waitress in her leopardskin is leaning over the purple shirt.
Whos reading a sexy mens magazine. Pausing, he pulls a huge
fluorescent flashlight still wrapped in hard plastic cover from a bag.
She points out (still speaking [naturellement], French): its no good
without batteries. Laughing. I can smell him. The conversation
segueing to European-French actress Catherine Deneuve. The waitress
declaring in drawn-out Québécois dipthongs the Europeans looking down
on, Deneuve "plate," boring: "Always the same tone." Outside a
friend passing by window. Looking for a date. Very strong shoulders.
Her long red hair streaming out behind. I know she has latex gloves in
her bag. Walking naturally, she "vogues." Causing her to get thrown
out of womens washrooms. For being "wrong" gender. I am thinking how
certain minor or unusual demeanors, if flaunted, getting read
extrinsically as unappealing or threatening. (In Canada, "Québécois"
often = flamboyant or risqué; coincidentally, same thing for
"queer"). This can be devastating. Or interesting. Friend passing
again, very feminine in wrap-around skirt, curly red hair. Yet walking
as if faking it. I am thinking how narrator (other). IF not knowing
how friend herself-self-perceiving, able to create a relationship with
reader permitting permutation of both obvious and unspeakable. The
body being capable of gestures contrary to understanding. I am
thinking about narrator as double. About evening out subject/object
weight at each end of sentence. A word about affect:

[It has never occurred to me to be a poet. The poet, with rare
dazzling exceptions, even when "absent," looms imbricated. In her
total façade of language. While reader happily at play. In her in
sandbox of spaces. Lacking spontaneity, I am drawn to the violence of
animation. Experienced by a subject. Drifting towards object. Across
the placement of the verb. Which nakedness, exposure, seeming somehow
progressive, egalitarian. Yet failing to make woman (narrator) cease
obsession with beginnings (causes) and endings (conclusions). So
trauma still risking terminating in single unbearable seduction scene.
I am thinking of certain literary feminists. Who using devices copped
from poetry. To construct porous or unbounded subject. Capable of
merging "more" ecologically with context. I am thinking of the gap
of the unspeakable. There may be no animal boundaryjust the stream and
the pleasure that lies in it, teasing the poet.** I am thinking
about the portentousness of sentencing. Alternately (defensively?), I
am thinking that a sentence in a community of sentences (paragraphs)
somehow leaving impression of consciously reaching out to other(s).
Notwithstanding characteristic narrative flick of head back over
shoulder. At point of the period. For purpose of getting . . .
bearings. This I finding . . . touching. A word about the geography of
the bar]:

Many empty tables. Two beefs in dark corner. Chairs fading outward.
Towards sunwashed waitress, purple shirt and harsh light of street.
Waitress, flashlight and me. A sign above our heads: "Les crevettes
de MATANE arrivées!!! [Fraîches.]{.underline} MATANE shrimp in!!!!
Fresh. The drawn-out Québécois fraîîîches savorously feminine and
plural. The waitress and purple shirt still complaining Deneuve
lacking edge. Offering as replacement, Québécoise country music star.
Recently coming out with "fabulous CD." Though "star" still having
to work nightly in bars. "Very tough. If youre pregnant." Outside,
young nomad in artfully torn outfit and $50-dollar-haircut. Asking
for change in anglicized French. They come here from the suburbs. Not
to feel guilty. In this huge dark room with stuffed animals on walls,
I am thinking of simulation in a diminshing French-speaking city,
where everyone considering themselves minority; yet in some way also
faking it. I am thinking of consequence for narrative, so often
straining toward "natural" on site where continental popular culture
in perpetual transmigration from Germanic to Latinate. Of Mickey
Mouse, Patsy Klein, Sylvester Stone, moving lips in English. While
saying something else entirely. I am thinking of living on a
Renaissance Ponte Vecchio: less bridge between than Babel of
echoes.** Whose interpretation requiring, precisely, resistance to
meaning. I am thinking of narration as introjection. Many friends have
dentures. A word about hybridity.

Two blocks up. Little stages. Blue-and-white fleur-de-lys flags for
the fête nationale. The Argentinean tango I missed. Somehow having
erased Québec "patron" Saint Jean Baptistes bleeding and miserable
little lamb. Featured in earlier decades national feast-day
celebrations.* Fête progressing north. Group doing samba. Québécois
folk songs. Block production of Molière farce. Free good food.
Everyone speaking French "with accent." Whole family dragging
mahogany dining table out on sidewalk. Now eating supper. Later, I,
sleepless, listening to thunderclaps on John Cage piece. To compensate
for dryness. Leopardskin waitress offering another glass of vinegar.
Muscled guy in tight sleeveless t-shirt and gleaming chain with cross.
I am thinking of narrative as opaque barrier. There is no limit
between life and deathly fascination. Viva Che! on wall. Now I must go
before another cigarette. Buy food. Take messages. If any. The disease
is not under control. Police car outside.

| Because it leaves them alone it is narrative.



# Anne Stone: Why write narrative when you could be the next guest on the Jerry Springer show!



**I met someone** whose tattoo had been sliced out of his arm, leaving a
jagged scar in place of the name of city he was born. I understood the
urge, to inject a place under your skin, only to have it removed like
a second stomach or a wart. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about
place. If you ask me where Im from, I can answer in a lot of different
ways, none of which would tell the whole story, or even manufacture
the kind of sense I would want to live with. I could show you the scar
on my leg and point to an intersection, or trace the scar angling up
from the first phalange on my index finger, pointing out the parking
lot where the Streetsville liquor store used to be. I could tell you
about strip malls, or stock yards, or franchised donut shops that
remind me of Dresden the morning after, draw you a map of the
territory in the fine sprinkling of ash collecting on a Formica
counter. I could tell you about the derelict cornfields that used to
be where that donut shop is now, or the first place I lived in
St.-Henri, show you the abandoned granary that burned to the ground
seven years ago and has since been replaced by industrial trailers. Or
maybe the building I lived in itself, which is sealed off now. I might
point out the remains of a much older structure, a series of
barn-board sheds. I would go to one of those sheds each afternoon to
write. The pick-up-sticks anatomy of that place inspired local kids
into acts of arson. I dont know if it was my own narrative tendencies
or the steady supply of thirteen year olds with zippos, but it was the
first part of the building they chose to tear down.

I should tell you, before we go any further, that the scar is really
on my pointer finger. You should know this story is not particularly
reliable and, as a friend told me once while I was staring absently at
a menu, the map is not the territory.

Somehow, during the months I spent in that shed, writing what would
become **jacks: a gothic gospel**, the smell of the packing plant my
father took me to as a girl infiltrated the barn-boards. The plant was
on his delivery route, and I used to stop off at the stock yards to
pet the shit-stained flanks of cows as they were herded into
slaughter. St-Henri reeks of my childhood and the Streetsville liquor
store is as organized as a months supply of birth control pills, the
bins of national and international wines formatted on the principle of
a 28-day dial, the kind that comes complete with seven sugary pills to
remind you of the color red. When I think of all the places that have
come to dereliction, I understand myself in terms of the word
tenacious. I know it is only my thinking that makes it so. I dont know
if they hand out birth control pills to fourteen year olds anymore,
the kind that remind me of a flattened representation of a monthly
agenda or a rolodex with a daily regimen of business cards. I do know
that the smell of those stockyard cows do not belong in this essay.
Nor does the way they kill cows in the Eastern Townships, which is
much more and much less personal.

I also think its important to tell you, before I go any further, that
I am not a vegetarian.

On my friends farm, the breeders have names like Sophia or, out of
earshot, are called after her daughters-in-law. The cows she will
slaughter and wrap herself are named after beige-toned bureaucratic
dociers. When I first met the woman who owns this farm, I asked about
the cows and was given the names of the breeders and the bull, the
others implied by a slurred ellipsis or existing as the space-off to
her story. I persisted, asking about one of the cows shed passed over.
"T-2306? Or do you mean that one?" she asked, pointing to Sophia,
"theyre sisters." A little later that day, she promised to save that
cows thigh-bone for my dog.

The cows exist in terms of place. The cows of the stockyard and the
cows of the townships farm are the same breed, indistinguishable,
except for their deformation in terms of place. Even their smells are
different. Sophia and T-2306 are twin sisters, born on the same day,
from the same uterus.

If I were to write about T-2306, I would want something of that
tension to come through. The format of the place infiltrating
something which might be appalled identity. Or perhaps by identity I
mean body-as-place. If I were a photographer, I might take a
long-exposure photograph, the kind that effaces her body if it implies
movement, if her body-as-place shifts in relation to geographical
setting. The immobile objects and landscape would exist in the picture
as perfect solids. It would be an unremarkable photo, except for the
way you could see right through the cow to everything behind it.
Except for the way the picture would be taken as daylight gave way to
dark, and something of that lumen would gather the hide together into
the appearance of a bruise.

The length of exposure is an interesting way for me to begin to think
about length in narrative. As I am given to understand the technique,
if you lengthen the time that the shutter is open, the camera slowly
tucks whatever light there is into an objects surfaces. Ive seen night
photos taken with a long exposure, the light isnt reflected off the
surfaces of an object so much as collected there, staining the fabric.
The light appears to be a dirty liquid, seething up from under. The
implications fascinate me, the way that pulling sight long can deform
what is there, or ways of seeing it.

Thankfully, I am not bound to a single snapshot, because I want to
examine (and re-examine), lit (et relire), bed (and embed), these
surfaces, under-pinning the impoverished look of St-Henri, for
instance, with the reek of a west-end Toronto slaughter house, twenty
years distant in time, and 600 kilometers away. I want the space-off
of the shed I started writing **jacks** in to be that terrifying
plant. God: What is that? What is it? The dingy white towers next to
the stockyards are organized vertically, even though, as everybody
knows, cows are organized horizontally---they are grazers, right? So,
between the slaughterhouse and the packing plant some terrible
deformation of what it means to be a cow occurs, the axis of cowness
undergoes a grotesque skew. How do you even fit the word "cow" in a
building that tall? What could a building with elevators possibly have
to do with a cow? When I was a girl, I wasnt afraid of the men with
electrical prods, or the smell of shit and death. But I was terrified
by those vertical towers. I knew they embodied a cold and impersonal
force. If I called out to the men prodding the cows, for instance, I
could get them to talk to me, stop what they were doing for a while. I
doubted my presence could effect a pause when it came to anything in
or about those buildings. It wasnt so much that I didnt exist, as it
was that in their terms, I could not possibly exist. I lacked the
relevance to insist my own axis likewise undergo some miraculous
Holstein shift from x to y. The plant excluded all terms but those
present in its formula. If I had Goëdal for a companion on those walks
through the slaughterhouse, they might have made another kind of
sense. As it is, the memory refuses my attempts at sense-making, and
continues to fascinate me twenty years later. The shed I came to
narrative in has been torn down, and the vertical granary -- the one
that existed at the place where Beaudoin stutters to a stop at rue
St-Ambroise, the one that once implied the axial-shift undergone by a
field of wheat -- burned to the ground one winter night as I watched.
These places have a grammar that I am only now beginning to grapple
with (or make-up).

I should probably confess that Ive apprehended a similar syntax in
unfamiliar restaurants. Once, a maitre-D unfolded my body like a table
cloth, the surface tension flattening and lengthening my body to the
skin of water, it delineated a lumen that precisely. Sensing some
terrifying grammar, I found that the only punctuation legible to me
were the round bottoms of oven-warmed plates pressing into my back
like a series of medieval cups. The kind 17th century doctors heat
with candles before placing in rows on either side of the spine,
creating a series of tiny vacuums to draw the suspected impurity up
from under. I find restaurants inscrutable. I mean, who would think to
spell the word "spent" on a plate in a diagonal line of cutlery? But
god, the relief to discover there was a silent means to signal an
impending departure.

What happens in the meantime? As your liminal-linen body hosts a
series of plates? And yes, physically, the body is a place that can,
with some effort, be occupied by one's self, or by others.

I am not at a restaurant. If I close my eyes, I lose my boundaries,
the air is tepid against my skin, no rough frisson strokes this
surface. I am not sensitive enough to maintain a secure sense of where
I end and something other begins. That requires a lepers perpetual
gaze to the extremities. If I were to close my eyes and begin typing
by rote, you would have to remind me: Where are my arms just now? my
fingers...

I am only sure of the tips. As they pad against the keys. One of my
fingers describes an unstable arch. Ive pulled a tendon with this
incessant tapping. It must be a very tiny tendon, the kind of thing
you might extract from the haunch of a bisected frog. Eyes closed, I
am the stoop of shoulders, the curve of a sore finger, and a series of
insensitive pads Ive developed as a result of my obsessive
predilection for narrative -- long narrative.

This is where I am today, and not at a restaurant packing plant. I am
at the place the scar on my index finger describes, an intersection
between place and the body. Writing narrative affords me a lateral way
in which to think about the body, about place, about the body in
place, about the body as place. In **Hush**, written very much like
those long-exposures I talked of earlier, the women exist in terms of
place---a narrative focus that, on the surface, would deny movement.
But writing against the vertical axis, implying it, even as I choose
to write on the horizontal plane, I can let a particular image accrete
to itself all sorts of other resonances---not just in the way a
particular image occurs in relation to her-body, Roses body, Loralies
body, but how it recurs, in relation to other events or objects or the
place itself.

Plot is a term that I hear twice, I hear the English plot and the
français plotte, or cunt---so it is a gendering of narrative. I am not
about plot. But am about this other form of plotting in narrative. Of
telling a story that unfolds at the level of language, where the words
I use recur over the length of the narrative. The repetition becomes
skewed, and what it touches, likewise becomes communicable. It isnt
mood, or even sensibility Im aiming at, though thats what descriptive
words are employed for a lot of the time. No, what is here is as
convoluted as the vaginal tract of a snail, and though yes, snails
plottes are bundled relatively small, they do possess immense surfaces
to play on.

I should admit Ive forgotten the word for a word that is descriptive.

Where am I going next? I want you to imagine a picture taken with a
very long exposure. No. I want you to imagine you think of the phrase
"glory-hole" every time you hear the word exposure, and then I want
you to imagine a picture taken with a very long exposure. A picture
taken on a night at the circus. The temporal trace of the antics of
acrobats and Dahlmer-clowns rendered in fly-wheels of color. Are you
sufficiently distracted? Good. Because until a moment ago I was
holding a Polaroid in my hand. It was a very old picture, or else,
someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make it look that way. The
edges are black from fingering. If I was going to show you the
picture, evidently, I changed my mind, because while you were looking
at the circus-shot, I slipped the picture into my pocket and lit a
cigarette.

I think you should know that I am familiar with the practical
applications of luting agents.

# Michelle Tea: Explain



 

**I get asked** sometimes to defend the way I write. To explain how it's
um writing I guess. Because I'm not making stuff up so why do I think
that anyone wants to hear about my crappy life. Well then don't read
it, punk! It's all I can think about, my own life and your life too.
I mean, what's everybody doing? I really want to know.

What if fiction writers had to answer dumb questions like that. Like,
What makes you think we believe this crap? How the hell do you know
what that geisha was thinking, white boy? Or, What are you afraid of?
Are you trying to hide something? Who are you, where can I find you
skulking about in these pages?

Oh I don't want to divide and conquer the writers. I like fiction, I
just read **Jesus Saves** by Darcey Steinke and it nearly put me in a
coma. My stomach hurt so bad I had to put it down, rest it on the dash
of a van that was rumbling through woodsy mountain landscape, manly
land, hunting land, in a state famous for serial killers, and in the
pages of this made-up story a little girl is tied up captured and
doomed and I know it's true, I mean, these things happen. I read Jenn
Banbury, **Like A Hole in the Head**, and it made me want to fuck up
on some spectacular way, as opposed to my normal, low-key fuck ups.
Those stories were really good.

But I just think it is so exciting that life can be so meaningful,
that you can smear it on a page and it's really important. It's as
much of a story as any fiction, but it's a document too. It happened,
so it's history. I'm reading **The Unsinkable Bambi Lake**, it's
before me on the table right now beside a rack of blueberry muffins
and a pile of bills that can't seem to pay themselves. When I read
Bambi's book I get to hear all about how cool my city, San Francisco,
was in the 70s. All the stuff I missed, victorians stuffed with
glamorous and dramatic G.A. queens, glitter and dustbunnies in the
corner, Bambi backstage in Berlin giving Bowie shit for selling out
way before that Dancing in the Streets fiasco. Dangerous boys and
hustlers, getting on estrogen, really just living a life, her own.
This question about 'memoirs', I think: are they asking about form
or structure, or really, am I being asked if my life, if Bambi's life
and Eileen Myles' life, and Cookie Mueller's life, are they asking
if our lives matter? I think they are.

I'm lucky because I get to be friends with some of my favorite
writers. I sat with Eileen Myles at a coffee shop on Valencia and she
told me that Charles Bukowski gave her permission to write. He just
claimed it, his terrain. The horseraces and the bars, the night, the
lamp that lit up his lousy hotel. Why not him. A poet. Why not Eileen.
I read her book, **Chelsea Girls**, and it all clicked. "Bread and
Water," what is she doing in that story but being poor. Scrounging for
money, tallying debts to friends, having her period, drinking and not
drinking. It's a genius story and the whole book is full of them,
electric. I was zapped. Why not me. My poverty and the girls that
don't love me and how drunk I got the other night. How I was a
prostitute. It seems to be literature when guys write about it, its
practically become a genre, men writing about their transcendental
trips to the cathouse, their orgasms and revelations. Or men writing
about women's lives in general. Straight people writing about queers
and white people writing about every other race on the planet. The
writing that I love, it's the Other telling the part that got left
out, the truth. Not only a writer and a historian, but a spy. There's
this awful copy shop near my house, I go there all the time because
I'm too lazy to walk up to Kinko's. The guys at this place are such
jerks. I had a bunch of my books and he said, Are Those Your Books?
Yeah. You wrote them? Yeah. He makes this suspicious little
scrunched-up face. Are You Sure? he asks. He means it. Looking at my
dirty fucked up hair and tattoos scrawled up my arms and whatever else
he saw. You Just Don't Look Like You Would Be A Writer. Yeah well
keep an eye out for yourself in my next novel, asshole.

I'm at work and I get a phone call and it's this girl. It's 2:30 in
the afternoon and she just woke up. I can hear birds chirping in the
background like she's in some fabulous jungle and I imagine light
slanting through fat glossy leaves and her all rumpled from sleep in a
slippery slip that sticks to her bones. Do You Have A Bird, I asked. I
Do. What Kind? A Cockatiel. I wonder what its name is but don't ask
because I want to keep it wild the way she is. She got arrested by the
cops for tagging Freedom Is Dying in a phone booth, they hauled her
off to jail. I feel this teeny obsession with her forming, and it
feels a lot like needing to write. A sort of zinging that grips you
from the inside. There's a place for her in my life right now and so
I need to write her down. The other night we were both high in that
club that's so red, a deep low red that made everything red, my dress
and torn fishnets, her shiny legs she kept twisting around, unfurling
like a mermaid. The red beer label curling on the bottle that she
begged off the bartender for free. I want to tell you all about her
fantastic strangeness, the sexy awkward way she walks like she's
going to wipe out, how she's paranoid, the excellent purity she sort
of radiates out from her eyes all black and smudgy, her dirty hair. I
could tell you about her jagged poems and drawings and the tattoos on
her fingers and the sad Johnny Thunders song on her answering machine.
I could tell you her whole story as I know it, and I want to, but
it's not mine to tell.

And then she calls me the next day kind of wiggy, says I Got Tripped
Out Thinking I Was Going To End Up In One Of Your Stories. All the
time someone gets mad at me or else I worry they will. Where does my
life stop, where does it slide into someone else's story and then
it's their job to tell it. My ex-girlfriend is going to kill me when
she finds out I wrote about that time she flipped out and was banging
her head against my bedroom wall and I had to kick her out and she
told me to fuck off. I mean, that's personal. And can I mention that
thing about her parents? It seems so crucial to understanding who she
is as a character. But she's not a character, she's a person. And
she had this affect on me. Can I talk about it? When I went to Ali's
house and she was cutting her arms and there was blood on her yellow
sheets and there was the razor, kind of crusty on her dresser. I said
Ali, I Feel Like That's Part Of The Story, Can I Write That? She
said, Tell The Truth, Michelle. But then, Ali's a writer too.

Sometimes, maybe even right now, I don't want to write. It seems so
boring. There are so many rules and I made them all myself: not here
in the house, in a cafe or a bar. You have to take a walk, and think
about it while your walking, try to go back there, feel all hurt or
fucked up and kind of lost, feel really in love, you were just with
the person, you smell like her, remember how you ate a burrito
afterwards, what it felt like to crave the steak. You have to drink
something while you write, either coffee or beer, or sangria. If
you're getting a late start and the sun is down already then it
should be a bar. You don't want the place closing up around you when
you're just hitting your stride, you're going to stay up late
immersed in all this life. Also you have to smoke continuously, so
pick a place that will let you do that. Maybe you should get on a
Greyhound and go somewhere else a place with romantic terrain where
you can be with your cigarettes. I think, maybe I should just be in a
band. Play some drums. Maybe I should take pictures, that's as true
as any story I've got to tell. But it's so expensive. Once I didn't
have any money, and I hardly knew anybody and I was so scared I'd
have to live out on the street. And I thought, it's ok I can still
write. Paper and pens are easy, they're cheap or easily stolen, you
could probably get people to give them to you. And if something really
bad like that ever happened, and whenever something does happen that
really sucks, it's hard, I think well ok I'll write about it. It's
so consoling and so redeeming. When I have a friend who doesn't write
and I see her having a hard time, like she's lonely or on too many
drugs or something fucked has happened I think oh I wish she could
write it. Write it all out. She could be an enormous angel. Probably
she is anyway, but then she could see it all lit up on the page,
swimming there, shining back up at her, good lighting for the movie
that is her life. She could write the soundtrack. She could bask in
herself, it's the greatest. Writing is the greatest, and writing the
truth in particular. Your little slice of it. You've got that, and
you've got your body, and I think that's it.

# Mike Amnasan: The Universes: On Semantics and Learning



 


## 1

**I can't tell you** what I was just thinking. As in Augustine\'s view
of intuition, the associations I registered were too free of any
repeatable limitations for me to verbalize the experience. Perhaps
these associations were of diverging thoughts that have not departed
my mind. The most handy example of something similar is the
simultaneity of sense perception. Each sense perception is
specialized and in that respect removed from the whole and yet also
registered in the same moment. In the thought I'm speaking of there
were different concerns, we might even say a universe of concerns
none of which I can fully express. This complex event might be
considered incidental in regard to what I have learned to value. I am
now attempting to acquire a greater appreciation of something I
cannot verbalize, meaningful associations I can't excite a
recurrence of through keying words into a computer.

Semantic sensation is never original. It must always be familiar.
Language does excite original sensations, as in the sound of a
speaker's voice, but the semantic experience itself is never sound
or vision, or any other sense perception of the material universe.
Original experience of semantics would be like immediately
comprehending a language we never heard before. This kind of
appreciation is possible with music. Music we've never heard before
can be immediately appreciated as music, but semantics, like memory,
must always be a response to what is already familiar.

My concern is how to proceed. If I can only register verbally what
has already become familiar through cognitive means, my work with
language is *not* directed toward spurring meaning for the first
time. Has there ever been a first time in regard to comprehending
language? Is anything we read utterly strange, or is it rather
strangely familiar? We may read something and make no sense of it,
and later return to it and find familiarity as if we always should
have been able to comprehend this particular passage. This parallels
how we initially acquire language through a growing familiarity with
the effects of verbal expression. We learn to fortuitously repeat
limited effects. We grow to appreciate what we had already
experienced albeit as incidental and free of the constraints of
communication. Infants can distinguish between phonemes their
parents, having learned a particular language, can no longer tell
apart (Pinker 264), and meaning is similar in this respect. To
understand how this can work we must put aside the notion that
language makes meaning. If this were the case we would begin with a
rather meager supply of semantics that we would not want to reduce by
limiting what we come to appreciate. The verbal cannot originate
anything we come to value as verbal expression. Perhaps this is true
of all our senses; the original experience is what we take in from
sensory organs that does not result in sense perception, sense
perception being that which we perceive to the extent it is already
familiar to us, already among the effects we are prepared to make. In
this sense the original is not an object, but rather that which we
are unprepared to value: particular and unique effects we do not
register.

Perhaps I simply want to learn, having reaped benefits from what I
have learned in the past by reducing the number of hard choices I
must make or that are made for me. Does the construction work,
through which I make a living, decide what sort of interests I can
successfully pursue? If cognition is verbal then it must follow that
we can only appreciate what language excites an interest in. If
meaning originated in language semantics could not have the benefits
I hope for. The use of language would be the limits of its effect,
and all the incidental experiences that I accrue on a construction
site, when I seldom talk, and much more rarely about what I'm now
writing, would go for nought---or worse. My time on a construction
site would suspend the cognition I long to learn from. What I then
felt to be my most prized asset, the verbal, and all my work with the
verbal, would be suspended as I endured a painfully irrelevant
expenditure of time and energy. Furthermore my understanding of the
world might be contaminated by prevalent views that re-inscribe my
thoughts with unwanted expressions.

We can see that my disposition toward construction work is strongly
impacted by my regard for language, and this involves study that is,
in part, motivated by a desire to develop an understanding through
which I can regard different aspects of my life as of mutual value. I
want this view to be revised within different kinds of experience
that I am never fully "conscious\" of---even if some rehearsal of
what I cannot register is, at this very moment, being performed as
simultaneous events in my mind. Language is not only directed toward
fortuitous limitations, but also toward realizing a universality that
is always changing in its simultaneous instances of social
expression, expression that we cannot oversee, or monitor in any way,
but that our minds do, to some extent, incidentally receive. Mental
activity may be full of simultaneous events some of which act like
separate subjects we anticipate. It may be that these subjects, if we
are removed from interactions that disrupt our expectations, must
form into a consensus of what others will expect from us, and limit
what we can expect of ourselves, selves that come to behave as
sovereign beings constituted as a uniformity. Others become mere
foils, since they can only be modeled after this consensus that
determines what we are disposed to find.

Our only particular and unique experience is that purveyed through
sense organs that introduce stimuli from the material universe---and
yet language is often external, as in the example of lines of words
on a monitor. How is it so very different? How can it be lacking in
original experience if there is an external and physical text that we
respond to in the material world? The answer is that our experience
of physical language, whether as sound, or text, or raised dots in
the case of braille, is not semantic, but a different kind of sense:
vision, sound, touch. Even if vision, sound, touch, also respond only
to what is already familiar they still form our sense perceptions of
the material universe, while the semantic effect excited by language
is never a direct expression of material reality.

As you read these words they arouse an immaterial universe
simultaneous with your perceptions of material reality. A simplified
version of what happens is this: the stimuli from your eyes travels
along the optic pathway until it enters the region of the cerebral
cortex associated with language.[^2_amnasan_1] This
linguistic region responds only to the familiar stimuli, the marks,
that spur semantic sensations. Stimuli from the eyes passes on to the
visual area of the occipital lobe where it excites the visual
perception of the physical world. The visual follows hard upon the
semantic so that you register both without any discernable interval
and you cannot tell, from what you experience, that more than one
sense perception is responding to stimuli from the eyes.

The preceding description is far from an exhaustive account of what
happens when we are engaged by written text. Language could only have
developed because our response to the stimuli from our ears, eyes, or
the surface of our skin was never exclusively devoted to creating
sense perceptions of the material universe. Our perceptions may be
more of an afterthought. It is possible for a creature to have an
eye, and to respond consistently to stimuli from that eye without the
luxury of any visual impressions.[^2_amnasan_2] Such
behavior would not be derived from cognition minus sense perception,
but rather a reaction lacking in a consistent impression that could
become either reliable or doubtful.

When reading, we do not fix our attention on the series of characters
in order to receive visual impressions that we then interpret,
transforming the visual into semantic sensations. Sense perception
does not work sequentially in that way. We do not see something, and
then, after we have concluded seeing, hear a sound, and then take a
turn at smelling.

Stephen Pinker, in **The Language Instinct**, refers to the
linguistic as a sixth sense. When I read his book, I began to feel
less trepidation in regard to proposing that semantics is the sense
perception of, and creation of, an immaterial universe. Here was a
respected linguist repeatedly returning to the idea that linguistics
is a form of sense perception as I was. But this mutual appreciation
was one version of myself, while I was also aware that I had a social
identity, within a community of writers, as a construction worker
writing about writing from a position of disadvantage. This identity
presently determines what is expected of me more than anything I
could say to the majority of those people who are familiar with what
I write. Being able to cite Pinker may up my chances of convincing
others that I am not merely avoiding, through intellectual exercises,
the emotions, that fueled earlier writing. The proposal that
semantics is a form of sense perception does not allow for creating
new meaning as the direct result of innovative language, and what I
am saying will not be understandable if approached with the
expectations that we can create new meaning solely through
unconventional grammatical constructions.

If semantics must be consistent like any other sense perception, and
we can only read what we are already disposed to read, this is not to
suggest that there are no surprises in reading, or that we all read
the same, or that we should ideally read the same, or that we should
always use words in a similar manner. It does not even necessitate
that we must change our current expectations to learn, but rather
that we must form new expectations. This is an important distinction
since we tend to think of values as a set of values so that to change
we must replace one set of values with another. Perhaps this is the
path of least resistence, as in the example of fully adjusting to the
demands of some vocation we want to succeed within---but, what if we
want to gain the advantage of studying more than one discipline? The
material for interdisciplinary study would be available even if there
were no programs that encourage it. Perhaps the main concern, in this
regard, is whether or not we can become proficient without limiting
the focus of our interests. Can we learn, not only from close study
with expedient results, but also through a delayed cognitive response
that includes more material than we can consider within any close
reading? In "The Love of Reading\" Virginia Woolf speaks of \"the
process of after-reading." After a book is read it takes on a shape
"held in the mind\" (416). After-reading may occur days after the
book has been set aside, and this later experience may become related
to other experience; simultaneous mental events that were incidental
at the time of reading may become appreciated as meaningful
associations. We can see that the space-time of simultaneous events
is non-sequential; intervening experience does not conclude previous
events. Our appreciation of simultaneous events effects our
conception of space-time, and even what is continuous through
intervening events that need not determine the end of prior events.
We have the example of sense perception in which case specialized
processes occur simultaneously; we register very different senses in
the same moment, and this simultaneity of perception may very well
have developed from simultaneous mental processes we never register,
processes as incidental to particular occasions as continuing to
breathe.

In the case of my own life as a construction worker there is no way I
could make useful contributions to philosophy or any other academic
discipline if close reading, or some similar attention, was
exclusively how we learn, and perhaps my confidence in being able to
offer useful models is deluded. Within a fairly isolated effort I
cannot tell the difference between adding to current understandings
and my own ignorance of other people's efforts that I may simply
repeat. I may expend time and energy in a direction others have long
ago recognized the folly of. To some extent this is rhetorical in
that I have found confirmation for my efforts in books I've recently
read---but I do depend upon intuition to an extent that may seem
sloppy to anyone who expects strong textual support for what I might
propose.

My own social identity, and also my ability to think of learning as a
greater appreciation of what is already cognitively familiar, are at
stake in, to some extent, replacing sequential models with those of
combined influences, the influence of simultaneous expectations I can
never be fully aware of. Often when I write, I key words into a
computer as a one-time event that does not work well for later verbal
communication---even with myself! Though writing did excite an
experience that I believed I was fully expressing, the words I laid
down failed to spur a strong recurrence of that experience the
following day. Perhaps there were events occurring within cognition
that were registered as successful writing---but I was learning a new
emphasis on the familiar, at the same time as I was making language,
and I was not *only* reading the effect of what I was keying into my
computer. I don't mean to suggest that this considerable cognitive
delay is the only way we learn in regard to language. Certainly there
are occasions in which learning is derived from a close focus on a
passage that is difficult to comprehend without repeated readings in
which significant aspects of language begin to emerge, and it may
seem that we are bringing meaning into "consciousness.\" But even
this instance of close attention requires a non-linguistic, cognitive
response to make the already familiar appreciable.

If we cannot learn without others, and if, as I believe, reading is
not sufficient in itself for changing verbal expectations, how can
this learning even occur sitting alone before my computer monitor? I
do not know the kind of physical incidents and the frequency of those
occasions required to learn. We may even learn from anticipating
upcoming social events in regard to which our participation will be
expected, events that we have not yet entered. One important element
is that others we learn from do not have to be proven. We do not
unlearn if we find that we gained a new appreciation of a subject
through misreading what someone said---or at least misreading what we
later came to believe they felt they were saying. We may conclude
that we need to anticipate others more in line with what we come to
believe they meant, or we may continue to look for the unintended
meaning beneficial to our own study. The social stimui that infuse
cognition with original experience may not be traceable, especially
more enduring influences that occur over a greater lapse of time.
Since language is only acquired through cognition, new linguistic
expectations, that have a broad influence on our thinking, cannot be
the *immediate* result of verbal interactions.

We must be disposed to anticipate what we read before we are engaged
by language to receive semantic sensations. If this is true then we
cannot become self-taught through isolated reading. Having said that,
I should point out that I am not talking about having rallied all our
senses to participate in a social occasion like a classroom
discussion, and then later on, after we arrive home, reading similar
texts. Even the expectation that we may benefit by repeatedly reading
a difficult passage must be learned as a change in what we are able
to appreciate. If rereading is sufficient for comprehension (that is,
there are no unfamiliar terms or an unconventional use of a word that
requires us to turn to other sources like a dictionary or the
instruction of a professor familiar with the author) we must still
somehow realize that the components of what we are reading are
already familiar, and that we must adjust our expectations when what
we were initially looking for is not discovered.

When I speak of isolated reading, reading in regard to which I have
not become well disposed toward a text by any prior social occasions,
what I then need to read effectively is the expectations of others to
disrupt my satisfaction with the values I was trying to read with. An
important consideration here, is whether new expectations, that allow
me to comprehend more, displace previous values or become
simultaneous with previous values, adding to the mix. Both
possibilities occur. The latter case does not involve displacing one
social logic with another felt to be superior, but simply developing
the expectations through which to read a text that my life has not
prepared me for. I may then discover what was already, incidentally,
familiar to me.

I am trying to anticipate sufficient social involvement to lead to
expectations of further participation with what could be regarded as
incidental aspects of my own mind. My social position, is, and must
be, one of inferiority in relation to material I have already
assimilated. Despite whatever mutual effort I am working toward,
social inferiority is still an important aspect of my efforts. I may
feel *that* as my physical body, alone in an unsympathetic universe,
the vulnerability, the loss of control over the sensations of my
skin, my face, my mannerisms and my speech if I speak out in a
classroom or within some other public event. This physical experience
disrupts my sense of being a coherent whole "conscious\" of who I
am, and these occasions have always had this effect on me, but
earlier in my life I felt this disruption as revealing weakness, and
perhaps it does, but it is the weakness of risking a social life.

Poor beginnings left me too confident in my own mental resources in
comparison to the culturally-deprived interactions I was limited to.
Like Nietzsche's mosquito \"feeling within itself the flying center
of the world" (42), isolated efforts tend to return me to an
exaggerated sense of "self-importance.\" There is nothing within
cognition and semantics to prevent me from being highly successful at
meeting my own expectations, and imaginary others as well---though I
will, at the same time, feel a nagging suspicion that something is
missing. I have become deceived in regard to the expectations of
those others who I anticipate impressing. Augustine states "If I am
deceived, I am" (33), and it seems that he is talking about being
deceived in a social context. If I realize that I have been deceived
in anticipating the expectations of others I am a social being
learning from the effect of rallying my senses to deal with the
vulnerability of interacting.

Paradoxically it would seem that we exist, as social beings, because
we are not in full control of our body, our appearance, voice,
mannerisms, what anything we express means. Judith Butler states,
"If one always risks meaning something other than what one thinks
one utters, then one is, as it were, vulnerable in a specifically
linguistic sense to a social life of language that exceeds the
purview of the subject who speaks" (87). If we have no disruptive
memory of interacting with others, we not only do not "exceed the
purview of the subject who speaks," we slip into a false consensus
of what the language we use means.

Learning requires an infusion of original experience from the
material universe and, however much we may discount other aspects of
learning, while paying close attention to a text, reading, alone,
will not likely allow us to comprehend aspects of a text we were not
already disposed to understand any more than it will allow us to
exceed our own consensus of what the language we use will mean to
others. The semantic universe of each individual is private, and yet
the disposition to appreciate incidents of cognition differently than
we have previously is not. In that respect the potential of our minds
is not entirely our own, in that relying exclusively on our own
values is a form of deprivation, a reliance on a false consensus.
Isolated reading and writing can locate us within this deprivation;
vision is relegated to locating words, as the verbal appropriates the
eye, and other forms of sense perception become distraction or
incidental to reading.

I exaggerate. Our other senses do, and must, remain significant while
we read. The historical examples that Martin Jay provides in
**Downcast Eyes** suggest that a greater attention to text can result
in the denigration of vision as the purveyor of "truth,\" but, as
Jay points out, this need not result in the denigration of vision as
a rich experience. I don't know that reading and writing as a form
of sensory deprivation has ever been studied, or how it could be
researched since anyone isolated in their efforts, in the manner I'm
suggesting, would not succeed in drawing attention to himself, and
so, for me, this must remain autobiographical, a concern I will
return to.

When walking down a street we can register both the sight and sound
of people passing by and the traffic in the street. We can the feel a
breeze on the skin, the pressure of a backpack over one shoulder, and
the contraction of muscles, all at the same time, and this
simultaneity of sense perception is essential to our being---even
though we do not require equal focus on all possible forms of sense
perception. Speech is very different from written language in that,
though the semantic experience is no different in kind from that
excited by written language, the sound of a voice and even background
music may be considered enhancing. Taking a walk and enjoying a view
may be considered an occasion for conversation, as also may be the
excitement of participating in a classroom discussion. When reading,
we can begin to realize that the sensations excited by language are
not vocal, but rather sensations unique unto themselves.

When studying some subject at home we do not want to be distracted by
noises coming from a neighboring apartment---but we still hear. In
this case we may be preparing for experience within a classroom, and
take advantage of the different space-time of semantic experience to
prepare for expectations that may not be reflected in our immediate
surroundings. It will not likely help our solitary preparations to
anticipate greater involvement with the people next door---and yet in
a sense we do want this simultaneous experience to tell us of other
lives as we study, other lives that are not a diminishment of what we
are presently involved in. We should not be lulled, while studying,
into believing that life loses significance at the periphery of our
immediate experience of a particular text.

I cannot monitor all my influences---but this is not to suggest that
I do not appreciate what others have written. I would quote more
often if it worked out for me, but I edit so much that cited passages
tend to become progressively arbitrary over the course of
writing---and I am also effected by undo tension associated with
citing. Citing can be promotional in giving credit where credit is
due. It can call attention to other authors and works that may be of
interest to the reader, and perhaps more importantly it keeps others
in the foreground as a constant reminder that critical writing is not
an individual effort. And yet despite these important reasons to
quote others, in my own experience in community colleges, citing was
introduced as having two major concerns.

The first was plagiarism: stealing another's ideas. The second was
the need to provide textual evidence to confirm the worth of anything
we propose. I particularly remember fliers handed out in each class
defining plagiarism and warning against it---though I never knew who
orchestrated the distribution of this cautionary note. My
introduction to citing told me that we were being watched to ensure
that we did not get away with committing serious infractions, and
this emphatically warned of our full responsibility in regard to
recognizing when we were borrowing ideas, and to make sure that we
did not misrepresent any viewpoints we paraphrased. These may be
valid concerns, but not ones that I feel should be forefronted in a
way that turns the novice, unfamiliar with the terrain, into a
solitary being watched for possible infractions, since citing should
call attention to the first person plural of critical writing, the
others we cannot fully separate from our own experience of learning.

I remember, as a teenager, lying drunk on my back, in the back yard
of my parents' tract home. I was too inebriated to do much more than
move my head from side to side, through which I could see the stucco
back of the house, and the garage which, among other things,
sheltered my father's automotive tools (the trade he taught in a
local high school). Letting my head roll in the other direction, I
could see the redwood fence at the back of the yard. Looking straight
ahead I saw the sky, representing my freedom to seek out a being
identical to myself. I felt my drunken stupor to be of little
disadvantage for this impossible task; I felt myself to be different
to the bone from all others. Even if my difference felt undeniable
within a tract home development in the San Gabriel Valley, it was an
impression formed in relation to a very small number of people, a
tiny perspective within the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles. I
didn't have sufficient evidence to confirm or deny what I firmly
believed---and I never would even if I expanded the world I took an
interest in. My disposition was not due to a lack of similarity to
others, but rather that I saw them much as I regarded myself as an
isolated being. I could not see others as having simultaneous, and
sometimes incongruous qualities. I was poorly disposed toward
critical abilities in that they were not expected of me or anyone
else. Semantics remained a mysterious by-product of physical
language.

I felt an inexpressible internal conflict that formed me into a
mysteriously complex center, of little value to others; they were
mere foils for my troubled outlook. I felt that only I had a complex
inner world incongruous with my behavior and I regarded this lack of
the ability to act as a coherent whole as a terrible fault. I felt
such disquiet, such a need to rail against everything that made me
feel small. I was beleaguered by the anxious suspicion, barely
registered, that in richer circumstances it was possible to perform a
more varied life, a life in which projects in common with others
could displace the need to continually recreate an isolated self,
reacting to oppression in my mind.

Should I include autobiography? It may reflect the limits of my
social experience, and in that respect I often feel torn between
first person and first person plural. Finding it difficult to settle
on a pronoun is probably similar to a discomfort with citing, a
lingering weakness, a fear of leaping confidently into a position of
equal standing with those who I might quote. I want to describe my
simultaneous experience as a construction worker, even if it is an
inferior position from which to participate in a mutual critical
effort. Should I tell you of running to the underground MUNI in the
dark of morning, while pulling a dirty sweat shirt over my head,
because I lingered too long reading over this I'm working on? We
don't really know how important this personal information might be
if thrown into the mix of critical writing. Perhaps the singular,
where a plural is wanted, carries with it an overblown sense of the
subject writing, which should be dissipated within a mutual effort in
which having been influenced by others is strongly highlighted and
rightfully so, and I'll return to that soon.

Sheet Metal work, my only income, has been recently altered by the
growing aesthetic preference for exposed duct, and this has created a
tension between the traditional building trades emphasis on hanging
duct as fast as possible (duct that will be hidden above a ceiling)
and producing the sculpture of visible duct work important to the
appearance of the finished building. The use of the eye for hanging
duct is restricted by the need to get the duct up quickly, the need
to quickly handle the duct into aesthetic lines. We are unlikely to
see it painted within a finished building---which is just as well in
that the finished vision will not include the heavy, galvanized
air-tunnel, physically hoisted in a dusty, gutted building, a richer
physical experience than keying words into a computer as I'm doing
now.

One benefit of this work, an unexpected one considering that it would
seem to prevent me from pursuing the interests that I find more
compelling, is that it involves using multiple sense perceptions in
an exhaustive manner. Construction work can be a personal measure of
the value of what I have been writing in that it involves the
potential threat of viewing aspects of my life as mutually exclusive
and harmful to the realization of some hypothetical life more suited
to my abilities. This is something I am not likely to forget while
writing, and perhaps exhaustion has come to displace the tragic view
of looking at myself unsympathetically as if from outside the
construction site, from a campus, or anywhere else from which the
view of myself as a social being will be an expression of
limitations, a small circumscribed place in society that my desires
should perhaps be shaped to fit. Where the tragic view prepared me to
pursue the seemingly impossible, as an embrace of the unnatural (my
solitary life passed before me as is said occurs before death),
exhaustion has taken the place of my previous tragic view, becoming a
universal exhaustion. Even though I may be a poor scholar, *we* are
exhausting *our* abilities.

It may be that I am inclined to make pronouncements without doing the
research required to substantiate my claims---of doing the wrong
work! This is the modus operandi I am most likely to be accused of,
and that I feel a need to justify in that I find that if I always
need textual evidence to back up whatever I propose, I cannot
maintain momentum---at least at this time in my life. This doesn't
mean that anything I say comes out of the blue, but rather that I
don't keep track of influences, especially since there tends to be
considerable delay, and a great deal of intervening experience before
I arrive at what I may eventually express with some confidence. I
might then speak of this universal exhaustion as a universal delay, a
disjunctive interval, in which my efforts do not come to a sudden a
halt when I must turn my attention to construction work. Construction
work itself has more meaning as part of simultaneous projects like
that which I'm now working on.

## Working Notes

*As a poet, I'm so intensely enamored of craft that the line can
become my taskmaster, both beloved and despised. When I began the
piece herein, I intended it as a poem, endstopped and enjambed and
all. But there were so many stories converging---an autobiographical
story, an ancient mythological story, the stories of numerous
industries (the industry of patriarchy, the industry of meat, the
industry of religion, the industry of death), the story of the
archetypal presence in the day-to-day---that the messy horde of them
resisted the line's enclosure. The mob had a mind of its own, came
to quorum instead in the alchemical vessel of the very tall tale. So,
it was that a choice made itself.*

**My father was a lying drunk**. My father's name was Sin. He chased my
mother with a tire iron about the yawning frontyard. Then he invented
escape. As helpless in his absence as presence, my mother stood in
the same yard and wept when the floodwaters rose. The neighborhood
gossip, Tiresias, unzipped her cornstalk ears. She tossed her lit
cigarette at the garden snakes fucking and pronounced herself a bard.
She sat on her porch across the street and composed the epic of my
parents' frontyard which she sang in verses just brief enough for
the neighbors, in passing, in learn how to hum. It was the din of the
rain falling in squalls; sprung rhythm of maelstroms unravelled. This
is how I became acquainted with some of my pastoral cycle. I learned
to chant these slaughtering idylls from the bard across the way. I
was there in the midst of foul weather. But I remember nothing I was
not retold. These recollections are potsherds, fragments of sunken
relief dredged up and presented with someone else's commentary, as
if behind glass.

My memory is a museum of pieces of dubious provenience. The story
I'll tell is 5000 years old and is nothing if not debatable. How am
I to tell it, then? How about:

She ate me?

She ate me all the way back.
She ate me all the way back into childhood, all the way back through
birth. She ate me back through conception. Back through my parents'
wedding before The Vietnam War. Back to my father falling on a
bloodied Korean slope (shrapnel fucking his thigh where metal will
seep from his skin in the shower forty-eight years hence). She ate me
before my mother's birth between The World Wars. She ate me before
The French-Indian War, The Spanish-American War, The Sino-Japanese
War, The Franco-Prussian War. She ate me before The Ten Years' War,
The Boer War, The Crimean War, The War of 1812. She ate me before The
Seminole Wars, The Opium War, The Peninsular War. She ate me before
The Seven Years' War, The First and Second Silesian Wars, The Great
Northern War, Queen Anne's War, King William\'s War, King Philip\'s
War, and The War of Devolution. She ate me before The Thirty Years'
War, The Wars of Religion, The Wars of the Roses, The Hussite Wars,
and The Hundred Years' War. She ate me before The Punic Wars, The
Sacred Wars, The Samnite Wars, The Messanian Wars, The Macedonian
Wars, The Mithridatic Wars. She ate me before The Peloponnesian Wars,
The Corinthian War, and The Trojan War. She ate me before The War
Against Hyksos, The War Against Palestine, The War Against Arcadia,
The War Against Thessalia, and The War Against Babylon. She ate me
back into Ur.

Er. Utterance before argument. Er. The advent of war.

It was not entirely erotic. Entirely. It was grave.

She ate me, but I buried myself. I had buried myself before. Locking
the bathroom door as a girl and crouching down in the shower, my
hands cusping my face and my face urged at the tiles, I'd dream my
dream of the grotto. From Latin for "crypt,\" from Greek for
"vault,\" and in feminine form, \"to hide.\" Grotto, speleo-aqueous
myth of safety as in drip hole, gravity spring, lily pool, lost
river.

"The possible use of limestone caves as shelters from the effects of
nuclear weapons has received considerable attention in the past few
years,"[^2_andrews_1] in the juvenile water of the grotto
whispers the blind cave fish.

Sin drew the living room blinds. Tiresias pressed her ear to the
ground, discerning the clatter of hooves. Sin sat on the couch in his
shorts and chained my mother, for his children's digestion, to the
dissembling line of his industrial tongue. He stunned and stuck and
scalded and scraped her. He split her along the backbone. While her
head and her hocks and her skin were removed, we milled in the
lairage wild-eyed, waiting for our turns. Picture the herd slunk from
the mother, pushing and bumping about:

Suddenly, at one end of the herd, a huge thrust forward. The first
maddened layer crushes the next which crushes the next, and so on.
A wave of compression washes the herd. But the herd is still
milling in random directions. The wave that started crisply,
decomposes, becomes disorganized. By the time it reaches the
opposite end of the pen, the pattern's a mess.

The same thing happens to a wave of sound. Close to the source of
sound, the compressions are patterns of tightly packed molecules.
But the molecules have no direction in mind. They simply mill
about. The compressions untighten as the wave of sound travels so
that meaning near-grazes our ears. When the pattern is totally
thronged by the milling, the herd hears nothing at all.[^2_andrews_2]

I woke to my own furious bleating. "Kill her,\" I said. I thought
this would preserve us. "Kill her.\" And, \"Kill her.\" And, \"Kill
her." My siblings fidgeted deafened and dumb. My mother was
processed and canned. That night my father, laid drunk up in couvade,
gave birth to much of me.

We were feeding on hard-shelled, trap-doored things: augers and
miters and lightning whelks, spindles and turrids and helmets; horse
conchs and dogwinkles; mouthdrills and neptunes and clives.

I was going him one for one with the cocktail; a choking wash of an
audible note poured from a giant, irregular jug. Inky-mouthed, my
father dumped his boxcar eyes on me and spoke a hollow meander. The
body of his speech was dominion, the limbs of which were gifts to me.
Then, atavism buckling him under, he belly crawled into darkness. He
had drunk his alluvial fill.


Thus he lay till the morning of the day appointed for his
inhumation. The oven was being heated for the baking of the funeral
meal when he awoke, climbed out of his coffin and walked
downstairs, where he was found by the horrified cook, standing
before the kitchen fire, complaining that he 'felt the
cold.'[^2_andrews_3]

Deboned ham, he lived for years after out of spite for my skilled
accretion of matter from out of his pinwheeling arms. To me, he had
made these gifts: the me of power and wickedness, of plundering
cities, of rebel lands; the me of strife and judgement, of quiver and
standard and sword and club and silence and running and fear. He made
me the me of consternation, of deceit and dismay and lament. He made
me the me of kindling fire and the piling of burning coals. He made
me the me of righteousness, of triumph and travel and beer. He made
me the me of the art of speed. He made me the me of the making of
plans. He made me the me of godship and forthright speech and
deceitful speech and grandiloquent speech and divinity. He made me
the feeding pen.

Once I was so much of me, and he was a mummy of displaced vigor, he
gathered himself in his goatskins and prophesied the epoch of his own
replenishment. Sin developed an invasion theory. He called it
Revelations. He sat me on a scarlet beast and poured me a cup of
abominations. He attempted to swallow me whole.

By then I was known for Clouds Of Which Were Called My Breasts and,
of course, for my Wondrous Vulva.

I was called Lady of Myriad Offices: Queen of Heaven, Lady of
Victory, Light of the World, Leader of Hosts, Creator of People,
Guide of Humanity, Mother of Fruitful Breast. I was called Goddess of
Goddesses, River of Life, Shepherdess of Lands, Bestower of Strength,
Framer of All Decrees. I was called Opener of the Womb. I was called
Lady of Date Palms.

I was called Forgiver of Sin.

He had called me the Whore of Babylon. He had called me the Mother of
Harlots.

I called myself Bereft of Forgiveness. I called myself Indigestible.

That was before my chthonian striptease when flutes and facets and
flowstones were cleft. When squeezing, scrambling, chimneying,
jamming, rappelling myself into caveat, she ate me, which was as
natural as a logarithm. It was her due.

Tiresias' slumlord husband, having made of his property a catafalque
and leased his tenants to incandescence, was arrested amidst the
cremains. Tiresias packed her plucked feathers and eloped with eight
billion flightless confessors. I was left, big toes tied together,
legging the walls of the impermeable gist. What was I to make of all
this bruised and cutting matter? of the evisceration bequeathed me by
pall-bearing parents? (My mother had selected my casket from an
overnight catalogue while sipping a cup of coffee and sitting in a
comfortable chair.[^2_andrews_4] My father had won first
prize from the Académie de France for inventing a clawed forceps for
pinching my corpse's nipples to assure that I was dead.[^2_andrews_5])

I refused to play their thanatomime. I left them intoning Vade in
Pacem. I took to speech.

I spoke blank verse. I spoke canzone. I spoke tanka and terza rima. I
spoke bouts rimés and rondeau and renga. I spoke eclogue,
epithalamium, madrigal, limerick, lune. I spoke senryu, sestina and
satire. I spoke calligram, cento and ode. Ottava rima, projective
verse, quatrain, ballade, epistle, the blues. I spoke ghazal. I spoke
her to sonnets.

But she ate me; she furrowed my heart. Inside the asylum of her ear,
my language was rendered offal.

I had played awhile at cultic prostitute, at sheepfold, at castrate,
at the loosening of hair. The suspect was an effigy who moonlighted
mowing the yawning frontyard. He laid me in the lilies unmoored from
Tiresias' abandoned bed. He promised me strings and pulleys and
bells. But when I touched him, the webbing between my fingers grew
opaque with loss of blood. The mirror he held to my mouth clouded a
phrase of silver sulfide of which the text was ennui.

So I buried myself, and she ate me.

The causal meaning of my descent has puzzled somatic scholars.
Scholars have been inclined to dismiss as mere excuse my stated
reasons: bull-like passion, raw desire, libido, ego,
gestalt.[^2_andrews_6] The god gets antediluvean kinged. The
god gets hold of her leaking hair, and the god gets to wager a bet
with the Huns: if he lops off her head and commands her to run, in
how many steps will she crumble? The god gets the power of
conjugation. The god gets declamation. He gets flashes of lightning,
fits and wind. The god gets to steep in the rift.

I get the query fever. I get the conjectural choke.

The god gets oolites and porthole and spongework.

I get to peter out.

In the factory of piracy, god becomes god exponentially. I become
boil-in-bag. The fatal hemmorhage of me out of me onto an areal map
of the god: I am displaced into ambience; the god oxidizes and
dilates. The god is blisteringly explicable. I go wrinkled and clot
like jelly while the conduits of the graduate crawlspaces hook and
barb their own lips. Once every 20,000 stitches, they publish a
rattle elucidating civil war and embalment; I am painted as pale as
putty and petrified like marble.

The bookkeepers take to my carcass like germs. They digest me into
the emergent naturalness of that improving stalagmite, the god. With
the use of this technology, the bookkeepers patent the concept of
'freshness.\' My rind for the fruitful media.

The morticians of the media feign post mortem inspection. My
survival, assumed to be a chronic rash, is expurgated from the thin
skin.

But I live. I live to bury myself. I buried myself, and she ate me.

It may seem paradoxical, but at the mouth of the dissolving solution
was the fact that, in my depotentiation, I had begun to be decorated
by features that did the most toward making me interesting to the
average consumer in the age of space exploration.[^2_andrews_7] I had been fashioned, for instance, with wingspan and
tiny mythic hands for roosting, armed with light explosives, beneath
the eaves of the uncooperative. Through the benevolence of chemical
manufacturing concerns, I'd been given an eerie dripping sound, the
seepage of fluids, and manifest changes in odor, flavor and
appearance. I was steam-jacketed, coagulated, and encased. I wore
like condensation the impervious rock of the crown, the anklets, the
epaulets, the girdle, the napkin, the national brassiere.

How did I coil clean in the patriotic wake? Like an ant with a
slipknot sucking its midriff after the hoopla of threading a shell.
No one was paying attention. First I dreamt I was an old bull-cow
with horns, knocked on the head, head rent like a pod releasing, who
nevertheless, as the shackle embraced her, leapt and went running
down Rte 17, who was shot in the back and dragged by a tractor back
to be quartered and plucked. When I awoke, I went to the oak trees
and began to root at their faults. If I'm to be a stuck pig, I
thought, liken my final supper to a sumptuous mould.

It was the me my father neglected to feign to give. It was the me of
my own escape, the wild boar at the bars. The capybara, the kangaroo,
the camel, alpaca, the moose. The antelope, the reindeer, guanaco,
vicuña, the yak. I rumbled amidst the exotic meats, a pilgrim on a
bender for genesis. Numerous eminences and depressions later,
swirling like tea in a cup, I tripped off my stirrups and creepthed
upon the earth, the me of the lump, so that when the goats of the
underground breathed through my ears at a trillionth a watt per
square meter, I heard them as trumpets wielding a knife, my ears
bloated like eggs.

I scraped the many facets of my body off the pulpit, sorted and filed
my serrated edges, and took to the beckoning maw. The goats of the
underground waggled their beards. I straddled the glamorous
threshold. I was sandwiched between slices of contaminated hide;
lamp, hard hat, chin strap, sling, coveralls, knee pads, grapple. My
wholesomeness was immediately sniffed at, the nostrils of judgement
flying. I reeked of formaldehyde, hubris and want. Barred as I was at
the gates of immersion by fossils who chewed at my sutures, there I
swelled, an acquisitive cloud, resoundingly willing to bargain
because:


My ear had become a compass; on the guillotine thump of the goat
song, I could navigate the azimuth of a note. It was the cavel of the
muscle that cinched and gave about her mouth. It was the augury of
the slap and the swallow of her heart. It was a fracture screwing its
mantical smoke screen up her throat. It was Cassandra in her stomach,
the thousand-petal sibyl of her scalp; it was the soothsaying foci of
the curve of her palms, her fingertips the Chaldeans, her elbows
twisting weathercocks, her breasts portentous gyres, her legs long
scrolls of omen, and her cunt prophetic ziggurat, repeating and
repeating a clause of joint and parting. It was the structure of the
tragic and the anti-tragic fusing. It was the future, and I craved it
like a robber craves a crypt.

Sarcophagus, a tin vault containing two essential pieces, sacro
meaning "flesh\" in Greek, and phagus meaning \"eater.\" But from
flesh to eater we travel thousands of miles through the dross. At
seven hungry borders bribe the seven crooked cops.

I offered up bravura, and the greedy bones bit in. I left them
nibbling the image I'd assembled in the mirror. The goats and I grew
rubber souled and sloshed into the vibrant air. Beyond the vestibule,
the atmosphere was profligate with battle. Draperies and canopies and
columns fell apart. Across the continents of spore and bug, an oracle
came warning. I heard prediction sweeping with her tongue across her
teeth.

Disaster is a sexed up promise, and I would leach the lodestone from
my psyche for a hit. As it happened, there were sledgehammers,
forceps, aspirators, clamps. She vandalled questions from inside
herself and wore them like a lab coat. In the autopsy of accusation,
stones of gall and truth. I hemmorhaged quietude, certitude, poise,
balance, clarity, safety, circumspection, humor, confidence, ken. The
floor was slick with my giving way. The goats of the underground
donned mourning suit and veil. There was to be a feast. Bacterium
shuffled in.

I'd come in making choice and cut, a bundle of nerve and muscle. I
was sawed and reapportioned, matter rendered moot. Leg, loin, blade,
rump, topside, sirloin, brisket, chuck, ribs and clod and sticking.
We fucked alot, so fucking was a thing that I had left, but in the
gut room zero gravity, the gesture lost its heft. I took on strangle,
lockjaw, blackleg, taint. She was back-flood and breakdown; she was
lethal. I was hooked.

Bacon: a feature in a limestone cave that bleeds in colored streaks.
The name suggests both kill and cure, the double helix tourniquet
that binds the human palate. She was starving, and she loathed and
longed for being in my meat as when the slaughterhouse employee says,

Stick that bitch. I grabbed her and flipped her over. She looked up
at me. It was like she was saying, "Yeah, I know it\'s your job,
do it." That was the first time I ever looked into a live hog\'s
eyes. And I stuck her. And she bled,[^2_andrews_8]

and he means that it is intimate, more intimate than family, more
intimate than war. Despite the husbandry of scholars, we were not
sisters, were not enemies, not aspects of one self. We were lovers
which means bloodthirst, which means eaten and to eat. It is desire
carves the wild body into savor and into spoil. It is desire and
disgust, that is. But the dissection of the lover into delicious and
grotesque is plastic surgery through metaphor after the metonymic
accident of lust. It is a reconstruction full of mercilessness and
mercy all at once.


Hung up, I turned the green of badness and of newness. But when
you're eaten raw and rotten, you sicken those who eat. Rumor has it
Sin became my out; but family matters less to him than dirt beneath
his thumbnails. The truth is that she spit me up. The siren she's
remembered for was bellyache, not birth. She ate me; I was hard to
eat. I bolted from her stomach, her feral burden sprung.

Above us, kingships moved upstream, regions weakened under struggle.
Surpluses were stored and spent, craftsmen fashioned temples,
independent cities rose; mosaics, altars, frescoes; cosmogony
appeared and faltered, priests were fed and housed and crucified;
sheep were bred and shorn and slaughtered, society collapsed. Below
you, she was doubled with the loss of too rich a meal. I came up
flopping wet and naked and, in some sense I was healed, of the rigor
mortis Sin had put me in, the hunger of the daughter.

So, who is eaten, then? Who is eater? Bad blood fills the stomach
with a host of famished stowaways. And my memories are ships adrift
and whirled in the eddy. The log books streak and bleed and run, and
hard-shelled, trap-doored things---the murex and the triton and the
gemtop and the cone---make meals upon the pages, growing plump, in
turn, to make a meal for a scoundrel faking at god. I said nothing is
not debatable. Tiresias long sailed from here, her cruiseship sunk
and done, I tell stories that she dictates from the hulls of former
living. But the bowline of her narrative in my mouth's a fraying
twist. And Tiresias a suburbanite of the artifice of up-and-up, this
turn of gossip from the underground is mine to rip and knot.

I know one more yarn, and it is this:

The warrior pin inks his face a feast of luscious coil. At death, he
meets a hungry hag who feeds upon his facial labyrinth. Sated, she
strokes his eyes and gives him the gift of the vision of the spirits.
In this way, he can navigate the landscape of the dead. If his face
is smooth and left untouched, if he has no mark of carving, like a
vulture she eats his eyes and picks his sockets empty. He's left to
wander in forever, blinded like Tiresias in the myth.

I said she ate me, though she was no hag, and I am not a warrior.
These winding sheets I give you as a gift from past the border
between self and dissolution, between semblance and disorder, between
want and what's leftover, between killing and the cure is the tale
of simply sitting through the pains of being dressed by life, for
life and life some more. For the lifting of the skin from bone is
cursive to the examined body's page where we write scripts for
useful ruptures fed on ardor and on rage.

# Taylor Brady: The Onset Exits and the Damage Done

 

 Once upon a time, you could say anything nice, but you didn't say 
 anything at all. Diacritical ultimatums interrupted dinner with 
 definitions withheld from view so as to grow huge and ravenous in the 
 dark. I am making this up, of course, as others made it up then, and 
 thus the accusation leveled by a doctor and anatomist of fact named 
 Duplex, had it been voiced at that time, would resonate still and 
 call me to account, but since after all I *am* the one who makes this 
 up, and since I did, and since what is done is done in that image, it 
 turned out that the good doctor had mortified his 
 voice[^2_brady1_brady_note1]1](brady_note1.html)^ as an act of contrition for 
 the grossness of a speech impediment as of that evening still 
 entirely prospective, and so no accusation was made, though a list of 
 sorts was made up. Have I proven my spontaneity to you, and do you 
 feel free of the memory of that night, reading over the 
 transcription? Have you swallowed your tongue, or mine, and can I 
 make it up to you?

Once upon a time, there was a storyteller who introduced into a tale
*one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, caught off
guard, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the
falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely
incorporated and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude.*
Apostrophe runs away, as geological layers of forwarding addresses
turn the multiply-enveloped scene of the narrative into a palimpsest,
with reference to which the only certainty is that someone will
receive a paper cut rather than useful knowledge. However, in another
tense her face pressed out from behind the paper as from an interior,
all velvet-papered walls and lamplight, which the storyteller thought
to foreclose every time the story drew the curtain on a scene, the
contour of nose and cheekbone solidifying for a second in the soft
billows of that gauzy fabric which served only to insure that an
audience's interest remained with what the tale hoped to leave
behind, in its jerky gait stumbling from episode to episode.

Again, though, I am lying, as she draws the curtain back and lets the
light fall upon you there, a bit below her in the street outside,
where all presuppositions stand together in first and second persons,
and says, "I am not a bad habit, not on the order of the forces
'driving the urge to differentiate, to identify one and then two,\'
only for you to make the subsequent half-turn into saying that the
latter follows the former, as misdirected speech follows curiosity
about a lighted window in a cinderblock rental duplex on a dark night
with all the sodium vapor lamps shattered, duping an accomplice into
accompanying you to that theatrical "bad neighborhood\" in which the
passing audience method-acts its way into belief in the constitutive
powers of its own direct address to the emptiness of its relation to
the stage properties, when in fact I have been here, and have been
telling the story of this circle of light, all along."

---

Once upon a time, there was a man named Birdy, older then than now,
whose job was to remind a text on memory of where it had been and why
it had missed itself there, as if he were a third-person argument
between a first and a second person who tried to keep appointments,
but whose lives, in the event, were compromised by one emergency
after another, so that one or the other always got stuck waiting,
picking up the check, taking the wrong bus home.

"Otherwise,\" he said, coming to his senses already in an anaphoric
mood on the curled linoleum floor, decorated in a grease-beclouded
floral pattern, of a dimly familiar kitchenette, talking to no one in
particular, or else an offstage presence stuck in an abandoned
episode, "you\'d simply live the singer-songwriter myth, and have
nothing to say for yourself but a lot of florid weeping and moaning.
I knocked a little hole in your wall because I care. Pornography
drives the photograph forward into full relation to its time, and
becomes a method to produce clear prospects on what was once obscure.
I continue to love your body, the taste of your tongue and sweaty
ass, only because I simply can't imagine you, and see not you, but a
broad expanse of sky, on the far side of every window into which I
peep."


---

Once upon a time there was a man named Birdy, somewhat younger than
he had been in an episode just a moment previous, who gave the lie to
epistemology and remembered the exact contour of every pain his body
had ever suffered through, beaten into shape, even, perhaps
especially, when his mind had been on something else. Sitting in the
dark and hearing, from a door or two down the block, soft blowing on
soprano sax, he experienced someone else's clarity out of phase.

*"I was afraid he was going to eat me,\"* a particularly
disingenuous character in the family drama was just then reciting, in
rehearsal with the cop with whom, arm in arm, he or she was coming up
the walkway of half-buried railroad ties that kept the path from
parking slab to painted steel front door relatively dry and passable
during the summer floods. Of course, since there was no air
conditioner, Birdy had propped the window open earlier in the evening
with a stack of crank pamphlet literature, and so heard every word,
but refused on principle to believe in the reality of any of what was
said under such circumstances, and was maintained in his condition of
exemplary, self-consuming skepticism. By the same token, though his
skull was perforated as proof of the most certain kind, he could not
grant the veracity of reports that told of a mutant, cannibal freak
lying just beneath the surface of the duplex and chewing on the
sleeper's head during the sticky night, but maintained that this Mr.
Article was, if anything, a fiction of grammar granted temporary
substance by the growing thickness of ideological descriptions of
landscape. Meanwhile the sax was licking lascivious promises into his
ear from distant, microscopic horizons, so that, when his one hand
found his other hand scrabbling around his lap in the dark, his first
impulse was to turn on the overhead bulb and find a window envelope,
write a check, and mail away his first adjusted payment.

Once upon a time, my little bird, you were saying. Then the           
therapeutic architecture, its medical practice sprayed thick over     
walls and fixtures alike in anticipation of each new tenant, opened   
wide in a tiny, repeated gasp of cancellation, swallowing your        
evidence in this incredulous and barely articulate displacement of    
pitch and timbre by pure, iterated rhythm, as if it were a quiet      
conflict approaching silence, becoming a branded product, and we      
promptly forgot it all, and had to wait to recall you as an           
after-effect of our own belated recognition of a housing crisis.      



[^2_brady1_brady_endnote]: 

*Dear Editor,*

*Once upon a time, you could drive through the city stoned and create
a makeshift eclogue out of that fuzz of vague participation, much as
earlier drivers had created their pastoral investments with property
in rolling parkland. In the windows which were not plywood painted to
resemble glass, but behind which were walls painted to resemble
all-encompassing skies, people would perform the parlor drama of
their social obligation to your passing. Going through someone's
trash, or the stack of papers on someone's desk, or the pages
inserted by a printer's error into someone\'s typescript, was a hot
and dirty intimacy. The substance of a whole affair might take root
in a similar sense of euphemism.*

*Ours,*

*The Editors*




[^2_brady1_brady_note1]: 
 Once upon a time a cloud of sobbing strings pretended to 
 protect the figure of a woman in what was either a song or a 
 landscape, hovering above her and around her like moonlight and 
 water, but only in the sense that moonlight serves as the medium for 
 speculation on nuclear fission ninety million miles away in the 
 opposite direction, and water acts as a lens, focusing what it covers 
 into a disclosure adding the picturesque to the particular. There had 
 been an episode of some kind, starvation had loomed, she had been 
 forced, not without some ironic pleasure, it's true, to eat the 
 still-squirming flesh of an Intellectual in Red Bermuda Shorts, among 
 other things. Some of these things were clear, while others remained 
 titular. Under the titles were texts, lyrics she was engaged to write 
 so that a man named Birdy, no longer young at all, but who saw 
 himself now as he had been ten or fifteen years ago, solitary and 
 intransigent and correct in a concrete box that housed a single room, 
 plus toilet and kitchenette, might within those texts produce 
 disengagements by which the letters would emerge as black designs 
 against white paper, and behind them, whether reading or hearing them 
 sung accompanied by guitar, the people of this landscape might then 
 intuit the presence of himself and his Apostrophe - for thus, 
 tropically, did he continue to think of her - she beautiful and he 
 evil, or vice versa, or all one way or the other, so long as there 
 was some sense of distribution implicit in their roles. He identified 
 the luxury sedan in the commercial whose jingle made him think of 
 her, and bought it with the last of his royalties from a previously 
 pilfered tune, and named it As Such, driving it around everywhere, 
 even on rainy indoor days, so that the city and indeed the nation 
 might fondle the exciting and aerodynamic contour of everything that 
 was surging within him precisely as it occurred. *And the pleasure of 
 being a lover, of living by love alone, was enhanced in his eyes, as 
 a dilettante of intangible sensations, by the price he was paying for 
 it*[^2_brady1_brady_endnote]. 

 Apostrophe, watching it all in slo-mo, said to the unidentified 
 others sitting next to her on the dilapidated couch in the 
 television's blue-tinged glare while the cheap VCR hummed softly, 
 "Here's the part where he begins to think he's outsmarting - who? 
 not me, even he must have given up anything but the broadest of 
 analogies in that direction - but someone, nonetheless, who turns her 
 head from side to side, allowing his right hand to drip something 
 oily and bitter into the balancing mechanisms of her inner ear, while 
 his left buys out her lease. *It becomes possible to cut off the 
 supply of light from a house.* Look out for the landlord who tells 
 you he sees through the vanity of possession, for he's about to 
 knock holes in your walls through which later to knock a hole or two 
 in you." 


[^2_brady1_brady_note2]:
Once upon a time, you were expected here, and when you didn't
show, a place was set for someone who looked more or less unlike you.
You are sure to congratulate yourself for having caught me in this
situation, making it up as I go along, but no matter, my aim's to
bend all light into reflection, and so I have pre-empted your
discovery of this point of fact. *In this strange phase of love the
personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that
the curiosity which you now feel stirring inside you with regard to
the smallest details of my daily life, is the same thirst for
knowledge with which I once studied history.* You have knocked a hole
in someone's wall and now there is nothing to do but look through,
even as you realize that here is not the character for whom you
looked, but perhaps a near relation, a time perhaps a bit early for
your arrival, in which a beakless old waterbird wanders in circles
over a threadbare carpet, casting terrifying shadows out onto the
sidewalk as its circuit passes and repasses the lamp to which one of
its webbed feet is tied by a length of packing twine that shortens
inexorably with each revolution. Perhaps it has been a long time
since you made any further holes, any perforations in the
thick-napped paper that covers the interior walls of such a scene,
simulating an all-encompassing sky which wraps itself around the
outside of a train of events you were only moments ago riding as a
casually interested commuter toward some other destination
entirely---a long time, then, since you were a child, shooting at
every hint of movement with a pellet gun by the shore of the
artificial lake behind your father's rental duplex, knocking holes
in beaks of birds to create the asymmetry out of which a story might
take flight, *but in this case the mind, merely by recalling the
pain, created it afresh,* lifting "that of which we cannot speak\"
into a chiaroscuro of yellow lamplight swirling down a drain into
darkness as warm showers fell upon you from the hidden nozzle of
theatrical night.

"Tell me everything you saw, and what you think it means,\"
stage-whispers Grace Kelly in the fascinated hush that cuts off the
supply of light, her absent presence in this vignette responding to
your recitation, which takes up each sentence in the discarded papers
blowing around against the all-encompassing sky and makes of it an
opening whose dimensions are given in the aperture of the vocative
"O.\" Framed thus in the round zoom lens of surveillance, do you now
see the dashing figure you cut from afar brought into the tightest
close-up, made ugly and atomic?


# Nicole Brossard: SOFT LINKS

**These are the names** of places, of cities, of climates that make
characters. The clear mornings, a fine rain fallen for twenty-four
hours, rare images originating in America and elsewhere, two natural
disasters that oblige us to stick together in the midst of cadavers,
these are the gestures quiet or purple, the shells, the icicles in
the happy hour glasses, crockery noises or a light stuttering that
torments an instant, a slap, a kiss these are the names of cities
like Venice or Reading, Tongue and Pueblo, the names of characters
Fabrice, Laure or Emma. The words sharpened over the years and the
novels, words one spoke while breathing badly, while laughing, while
spitting, while sucking an olive, the verbs we add to the lips'
pleasure, to success, to a certain death. These are words like knee
or cheek or still others stretching as far as the eye can see making
us lean over the void, stretch like cats in the morning these are the
words that make one stay awake till dawn or take a taxi on week
nights when the city falls asleep before midnight and solitude sticks
in our jaws like an abscess. These are words spoken from memory, from
want or from pride, very often words pronounced with love while
placing hands on nape of neck or filling a glass of port. These are
words whose etymology must be sought, that must then be plastered to
what's called a wall of sound, in a manner like those who cry out in
pain and sigh with pleasure that wander in dreams and documents
assault the heart's mysterious obscurity. These are words like bay,
hill, wadi, via, street[^2_brossard_*] stasse dispersed through the dictionary
between flame-trees and neons, cemeteries, dismal and forests. These
are words sound the body of meanings that are claws or soft[^2_brossard_*] on our
chests, cold, shivers, furrows and fear in the back without waiting
while we try to split the sleek future tense with trenchant
quotations. These are words swallowers of fire and life, one no
longer knows whether they're Latin, French, Italian, Sanskrit,
Mandarin, Andalusian, Arabic or English, whether they hide a number,
an animal or old anguishes eager to gush before our eyes like cloned
shadows filled with light and great myths.

# Mary Burger: All New Yorker Stories


 


**All New Yorker fiction** pieces stop at the point where the person
makes a bad discovery about himself or herself or the world. That he
is or she is a failure personally---in love, usually, romantic love
or familial love---or that the world is a failure toward his personal
or her personal sensitive nature---that the world is violent, that
unequal distribution of power causes pain and unhappiness, usually to
the less powerful, but sometimes to the powerful as well.

Regardless of its narrator, its characters, its particular conceits
or conflicts, what anchors each story is the sick feeling at the end.
The same feeling that comes after a radiation treatment for cancer.
The queasy realization that all this, the technological
sophistication, the aggressive preservation of human life, is merely
its own reward, not a means to anything.

This is how the melancholic condition of privileged passivity
confronts itself. When a grown man behaves mercilessly towards his
humble, bewildered parents; when a wealthy young Latin American woman
is threatened with kidnapping and even death, right in front of her
own gated home, right inside her private limousine; when the mostly
likable gay neighbor, in the midst of his theatrical, flamboyant
prime, withers suddenly and agonizingly, and dies. When an urbane,
not quite young writer, supplementing her New York lifestyle with a
teaching job in the heartland, falls in love with a simple, decent
man, neither a New Yorker nor a writer nor even in any way
ironic---and simply leaves him, his marriage proposal, his simple,
open face, to return to her lair in the crowded city, her archly
urban self in the witheringly sophisticated intellectual world.

In "withering,\" a possibility that what is socially belittling
might also be personally devastating. That the intricate architecture
of social standing might collapse occasionally, like a poorly braced
studio set, to reveal something more like an experience arrived at
through contemplation.

When the modestly privileged, moderately young childless couple who
attend the adoption picnic focus on the same large-eyed, attractive
kid (that is, the querulous wife focuses. The ironic husband, whose
disavowal of the thing expected of him mimics Kevin Spacey's in
"American Beauty,\" instead alights for awhile with an aloof, jaded
teenager, whose unflinching lack of delusion contributes to the
reader's own worldliness), that is, the moderately young,
uncomfortably nervous wife alights on the same doe-eyed little boy
attended to by an imposing Texas judge and his Barbara Bush-edition
wife. It is an orphan fair. Like all bazaars, the most attractive
goods are fought for, the least attractive are left behind to grow
even dingier.

In this version, the judge and his wife are the cunning players. They
are powerful, and they are malevolent. The judge and his wife invite
the more modest couple to their lair, a large house on a large piece
of land by a lake.

With "lair,\" variously, the idea that the seeming impotence of the
self-conscious intellectual (the New York writer snagged in the
loneliness of her cleverness, the cleverness of her loneliness), the
rueful split between the life of the heart and the life of the mind,
is a familiar condition, the condition that seems to be most easily
recognized as a sign of distress, of all not being right with the
world. The dissonance between what you know and what you need---this
is the price charged for entry to the club. And who complains? Does a
young gymnast object that her muscle-strapped torso and thighs set
her apart from other girls? The world-weariness might be counted as a
privilege; anyway it's displayed often enough to be interpreted that
way.

Through the battlefield drills of drinks, dinner, after-dinner
segregation of husbands and wives, the older couple's battle plan
emerges. The Texas wife begins an oblique attack, a narrative of a
foster child they'd had, a black toddler taken from an addicted
mother. His mounting health problems and learning disabilities,
together with the difficulty in keeping a nanny---when enough details
had been laid out, the concluding sentence wasn't needed.

The off-register comments from the Texas wife about her foster child,
about finding the boy a nanny "of his own kind\" and a school with
"all different races, the Mexicans and the Chinese and the Indians
and all that," created another clear space in the story, a way to
tell what is right.

In the kitchen, away from the women, the judge's assault was direct:
he confronted the husband with ammunition gathered from his
labyrinthine legal connections: evidence of the husband's expulsion
from college 15 years ago for selling pot, evidence that the judge,
with a final flourish of legal muscles, had already inserted into the
husband's case file at the adoption agency. This in the few days
since the couples met.

But since the cunning of great power isn't really the story, or
enough of a story, it was necessary for the judge to punch the
husband in the nose and knock him down before the couple, and the
story, could leave the judge's house.

The women's exchanges, happening at the same time, were far less
direct than the men's but resulted in arguably more damage, like a
barbed hook that's slipped smoothly into the skin and then twisted.

It's true too that the young wife and husband wanted different
things (as different as a doe-eyed youngster from a disaffected
teen), a further cause of dissatisfaction.

The obliquity of the wives and the passive irony of the young husband
all form a rueful cognizance that weighs down to the point of
paralysis. And yet it's that ruefulness that cradles its hands
around the narrative's delicate crown jewel.

Like a lead musician the fiction narrator repeats and elaborates a
single sensitive melody line, or crescendos on a particular note of
knowing regret, a middle-aged loss of innocence, though evacuated of
any possibility that the afflicted might be rescued from the cause of
their desolation or even, astonishingly, change their own lives.

This somber performance seems to be the provenance, or the penance,
of the fictional narrator only. For the non-fiction narrator, the
feat is more acrobatic, if not therefore also more precarious.

The non-fiction narrator is permeated by a sense of ambiguity
impossible in her counterpart. While the fiction narrator lives with
the certainty that moral rectitude is real, that extreme power is
obscene, the non-fiction narrator is instead subject to the wild
cards, false leads, and missed signals of a lived life.

The non-fiction narrator tends to have an intimate relationship with
squalor, or danger, or pleasure, an intimacy marked by unguarded
revelations of vulnerability. She exchanges the reassurance of an
intricately self-referencing universe, in which each element
contributes clearly and inevitably to the whole, for rapport with the
volatile, the off-balance, the unpredictable. Her familiarity with
squalor becomes its own sophistication, her fluency in the idiom of
disorder, with its free-jazz syncopation and arhythmia, its own
seductiveness. The effect holds our attention like a sudden,
beckoning whistle coming in through the window of a quiet room.

In this version, the non-fiction narrator is free to both love and
despise her volatile, negligent parents, her alcoholic mother who
disappears on binges and returns home to demand attention and
threaten suicide; she's free to both admire and resent her slightly
older, vastly more sexually experienced sister; she's free to fear
and adore the coltish, sanguine boy she's had a crush on since age
six. The non-fiction narrator elides between bewilderment and passion
for her own still strange sexual feelings and for the obvious,
pronounced desire that persists between her parents even in the midst
of their pitched battles.

While the fictional narrator breathlessly cradles a fragile egg, the
non-fiction narrator darts in and out of the room bouncing a rubber
ball.

In the photo, a snapshot salvaged from one of those summers that were
both vacant and teeming, she is 15. Her long hair blown a little into
her face, head tilted a little to the side, lashes lightly mascarad
or just naturally thick and dark---she is the early 70's icon of
innocent sexiness, the womanly girl, what Ali McGraw, "Love Story,\"
and John Denver's \"Sunshine\" all immortalized, but what she seems
to be without trying, maybe without even really knowing.

It's that not knowing, or anyway not always needing to know, that
the non-fiction narrator settles for, but that the fiction narrator
battles like a riptide.

The one bobs in a tight ship just off shore, pulled between the
current and the undertow, while the rest shout and lunge in beach
volleyball, play with children, play with dogs, play radios, nap. She
imagines her voice as faint, or inaudible, from shore. The other
shipwrecks in the shoals and scrambles from her splintered raft. Her
escape is always in progress.

# Margaret Christakos: Often She Finds Butchers Flirtatious



## From *Charisma*

### Working Notes

*Charisma[^2_christakos_note1] is "for the chorus of us.\" I wrote Charisma over a period
of nine years, moving through and enervated by the political
prescriptions of middle-class feminist academia; craning my gaze on
women through the hourglass of my wounded relationship with "mother,
sister, grandmother"; diving through several portals of baby-shit
and bliss to wear the secret subcultural drape of motherhood; its
repeated re-shapings of Normal greeting my sense of "what happens\"
as a waking frequency of turgid extremes. I realized that straight
novels had always bored me, why I masturbated to make them more
interesting. I would need fiction to become a foodlike procession, an
irrefutable love-surrogate, imbibed to stimulate the senses. (Going
down on me.) I liked a multi-channel environment, not for its
staccato disavowal of the constant but because I had been raised with
an appetite to introject several stories simultaneously, each
contracting and expanding according to its own pulse.*

*Mothering a boy and then girl-boy twins often involves being unable
to regulate how much experience I confront; a surfeit of sentience.
An overflow of interaction, so that the negotiated space of
consensual relationship capsizes. As when one is in love with more
than one lover, or dreaming, or in hate, an oxymoronic prostrate
agent (who is) subject to the re-calibration of self-limits and
society's clichés about who/what is \"hot.\" I wanted to write the
storiedness of bisexual subjectivity (even tho maybe rejected by
queer command-central) as a kaleidoscopic inner identity script of
positive contradictions and overflow, and to acclaim cunt-agency for
mother subjects. A story that managed to open gender itself like a
cocktail umbrella, with the notion of the gendered character as a
laquered overarch of spokes. As persona spoken and collapsed again,
efficient and portable to other stories, ducking in and out of brief
theory showers.*

*When you winked your way through the glass we knew it was a cover.
We wondered about ourselves then, about the social organization of
gender categories, about barriers to the heteroerotic--we mean
hetero as in plural, different and manifold--desires we could feel,
we wanted you for our tutors in studies of the self, ours and yours.
To tell the story because it's a-hankering to be told. The novel was
more cyclonic in form before the final edit; I attributed extra value
to narrative contiguities once I had hung out with non-writers and
babies for a while. I wanted the book to fly.*



### CAMEO

Often she finds butchers flirtatious; out on Danforth Avenue where
the anemic lamb carcasses suspend for three or four seconds her trust
in bodily safety, before the mind rescues her from moral crisis. Just
a piece of meat like any. It's the hook, the hook that hooks, that
perforates the eye, the brain, the guts of sympathy which must be let
down, rinsed and laid in the cedar drawer until autumn. A time when
ghouls are acceptable again and the skeletal dance of baby sheep is
seasonally admired. Dressed in his white blood-smeared coat, he is
like any irresistible and prodigious surgeon. He wears the coat, the
lamb's clotted juices and pristine plate glass. He sees the world
through hooked sides of things. Why be afraid?

Flirtation has to do with how the lambs are led along the corridor of
doom. How they go and go. How they continue up the ramp while their
cousins shriek. It has nothing to do with Easter. With men and
beasts, rather, and strangers who may be beastly though their
flirting may become on occasion beautiful. The natural frame of the
plate glass composes him in savoury labour, up to the wristwatch in
precision. He peeks through the space where the organs were to a
woman's tenuous shock. Hooked by the blood of someone else. Thing
else. Some other thing‚s public juice. And the fixed sway of the dead
meat muscle---Cameo is a sitting duck.

Cameo coaxes the lamb chops from their wax paper sleeve and lays them
on sizzling garlic. She scoops mint jelly into one of her mom's old
teacups, and amuses herself while the meat goes bloody by holding the
porcelain overhead---there they are, as delightful as when she was a
girl, green shadows flickering through the cup's delicate filigree.
Impatient to eat, she flips the chops, sniffing in their high
corduroy bloom, flexing her knees to an old disco song. Gradually the
element's blue flame singes her dreamy gaze and she fidgets with her
too-tight bra strap, then jets out her arms at right angles and
croons into the kitchen window, hopping from one foot to the other
and pulsing her hips. Soon, the smell is so velvety she is near
euphoric. She unloads the shining chops onto a plate, spoons coleslaw
on top of the steaming jus puddle that runs off them, selects her
favourite bone-handled cutlery, and sets these, a napkin and a beer
on a silver tray. As she passes the hall mirror, she transfigures the
carefree, dimpled smile on her face to a farcically enamelled grin,
and, childlike, the round-jowled reflection catches itself awkwardly,
averting its eyes, a dinner guest of inferior status. Well, fine. She
just wants to fade in front of the McNeil-Lehrer Report while reading
Interview. Clarence Thomas is deplorable and River Phoenix has
siblings named Rain, Liberty and Summer, and Keanu Reeves is part
Hawaiian---so that's it---explaining his preternatural gaze. She
thinks about licking his eyelids. She doesn't mind such overlays,
allowing that the real Keen and his big-screen simulacra have little
in common. The pastoral fogs up and loses its colour when she
remembers Keanu went to the same high school as an ex-lover's
sister, Korona, the mesmerically sirenic just-past-teenagehood dyke
who moves like a rock stud at the Marzipan Room. Same eyes. She
considers herself curled up in a wet tongue licking those eyelids.
Then the newscaster misses a beat describing a murder-suicide in
which the ex-boyfriend used two industrial meat hooks to set up the
nooses. She shuffles into the kitchen, unloads pink bones into the
garbage, rinses her plate and balances it in the dish rack. Humming
an unforgettable TV ad promoting eternal brand loyalty, she flicks
the one-cup switch on the espresso machine and reaches for pungent
cinnamon and powdery, bittersweet cocoa.

Cameo goes to the local butcher, a garrulous older Polish woman,
because the baby needs lots of iron and protein. Hardcore nutrition.
This meant meat and potatoes, meat and rice, meat and pasta when
Cameo was growing up. Lamb stew, pot roast, liver and onions,
spareribs with ketchup applied during the last ten minutes to get a
braised country look. She imagines the placental tissue forming, a
red sirloin in the epicentre of her psyche. Like drawings she
happened upon at a gallery, of galactic uteri with trees and dreams
growing inside. Already her own dreams make her anxious. She takes a
baby boy home from a supermarket, and somehow he can already talk.
She writhes about rubbing herself while holding him tucked under one
arm, then says, Do you want to lick me? He wags his tongue, starts
slurping at her vulva. After a moment he stops and looks up, cream
all over his soft little chin. She runs the tapwater and says
maternally, Do you want a drink? She tells people who ask that she's
keeping him if no one claims him back. The dream's meaning escapes
her over the cup of coffee she leans into the next morning, before
she goes to the deli where the Polish butcher will wink at her, Ah,
look at the glow on that one, making a big deal, and Cameo will like
the invasive boastfulness of her, the European excess; her
motherishness.

All week, in fact, she thinks a wordless blur of foodstuffs. The
bakery woos, Fresh Valentine Cakes Available. Signs like this keep
Cameo on track from day to day, remind her that English is the
official language even for her meandering body's new requirements.
When the other butcher, the young one out on the Danforth, slicks his
sweet right eyebrow to the ceiling, he is flirting in the queen's
own tongue, though his first language is probably Greek. In a fit of
hysteria libidinosa he might mutter in his mother tongue if she
lapped his incurvate dimples. Or would he wish this? Cameo silently
paraphrases in pig Latin how he undresses her in quick swipes, opchay
opchay, opchay, why waste such a precise and professional syntax! Try
to make sense, baby-mother, she chides herself, tenting her shoulders
forward to contain the cross-continental sound loop. A sign propped
up in the cooler says, Fresh Lamb Whole Or Pieces Suit Your Fancy.
Speechless again, she sees that the flirtatious butcher's open
freezer is layered with the slight upside-down leftovers of lambs
dreaming the disembodied envelopes of fur back onto their rib cages.
She starts shivering. He says, What'll it be, miss? With those eyes,
he could be her cousin. When Cameo comes here she dislikes the
imbalance, like she's a plate in a dish rack about to topple, but
she does come. And each time: the frightening image of a man with a
knife imposes itself into the hem of her ahem-hawing as she stands at
the pink-smeared counter. For what order to be uttered, or redress to
arise. Sawdust in her nostrils, metal blade at her view's rim.
Always at the edges his hand the wrist the blood the appetite.
Sudden. Her eyes close.

---


Once Cameo had thought about mother's cream in a strange way, a way
she could not after that first time continue to speak of. She began
to live it in code, through images of food, since cream was a food to
begin with. There was no other sort of cream she could allow out of a
mother's body. When she thought of cream or milk her thoughts often
turned quite pleasurably to snow, and then her arms would be swimming
in it, folding it back onto itself like slow motion film images of
milk spilling on a tabletop. Liking this picture, she had always
wanted to go swinging in a snowstorm, but was thwarted by Parks &
Rec's policy of packing the playground away in late November.
Children were known to get overheated and absent-minded in their
snowsuits, and the city could not be responsible for them burrowing
sleepily into snowbanks and freezing to death. She had almost frozen
once, surrendering too long on the walk home from school. The cold
felt like milk being swallowed as it slowly entered her, and she
thought of her mother, paying the babysitter for the hour of
lunchtime she was wasting flatbacked on the bank, thinking of milk
and a creaminess she couldn't place but missed somehow, like snow
angels in summer.

---

Sometimes Cameo feels like the carcass slung on the silver crook, the
freshly stripped and gutted one mounted in the showcase to attract
discerning customers. When she stops to look through the plate glass
she finds her own face grafted on the plate glass looking back at
herself, soft into the desiring hook of her eye. Perhaps she is the
woman she likes to flirt with, midday, as much as she flirts with her
threshold for abjection. Yes, part of going out into the world each
afternoon is to catch herself in it, raw and available. She slowly
learns how to protect the butcher, who winks and waves from inside
the shop, from her gut hankering for the woman between them.

---

### MARILYN

Happiness has to do with how the sleep goes and goes away, flood
water evaporating into mist. Cameo's eyes brighten, she pushes
upright and steps into the word Hi. Speaking first in her own person
and then in the echo of her aunt's spritely eyes. Wanna come,
sweetums, and meet Marilyn? Her aunt deftly snaps closed the hand
pouches on Cameo's jumpsuit, wedges each cluster of toes into its
rubber foot envelope. Let's go fast, auntie says. Fast, Cameo
doubles, the way she doubles everything in her aunt's face, her
sparkle, the discourse of her desire, Cameo would say now. Discourse
and desire.

That night, the mother and the aunt sit on chairs pulled tight to the
kitchen table. Their elbows grind into the wood surface connecting
them. A glass of milk slides around in its own white spillage. Don't
you ever take Cameo there again. How can you be so pigheaded? Don't
you speak about me, we're talking about you. You have no right to
talk about me like this, Chari, you have no clue. All I know---Is
nothing, is pig shit. Is what is moral. Your morality is a castoff,
from Dad, from the system, from the goddamned church. And what
happened to you, how did you get to be so selfish? Being true to
myself isn't selfish. No, Seal, what you are is confused, and I want
you to keep my daughter out of your selfish confusion. This isn't
Cameo's problem, it\'s yours, can\'t you admit it? If anyone here\'s
got a problem, Seal, it's you, end of conversation.

Cameo backs down the hallway chewing the tough thumbnail she has
detached absent-mindedly. Her mother's curt voice flip-flops like
bad perfume in her senses. But Marilyn gave her two balloons. Aunt
Chloris bought them all ice cream cones, and together they had swung
her in giant leaping steps up the grassy hill. She had been dangling
like a fish, giggling heartily, and the women both guffawed, a fish?
You‚re a whale of a girl, and don't you forget it!

Womens' creamy cream. Their cream. Mama\'s creaminess. Ooosshhh.

# Brenda Coultas: Failure


 


**I'm a failed short story writer** in the traditional sense. I write
the way I write because I have no choice. I wish I could write in a
traditional narrative shape (plot, characters, conflict), I mean that
I don't do characters that begin to talk and speak as independent
entities with free will. I've always been attracted to language more
than plot and character. And I hate most fiction. I hate the whole
artificial structure of popular fiction yet love artificial elevated
language. My last attempt at straight fiction has left me stuck with
6 pages of notes about Southern Indiana carnival life. But every once
in a while I fall in love enough to keep going.

I focus on sentences and images. I like to describe. I'm most
influenced by documentary film and photographic essays at the moment,
and taking a cue from visual artists and piling up a lot of shit
(dumping memories, images, found objects into a journal), then
sculpting it for a shape. I use narrative to connect, also I'm a
sucker for a narrative riff and for beauty. I'm called a poet and
prose writer and I'm at home with both titles: however, my main
company consists of poets and poetry is a large chunk of my literary
diet. Of course, I follow the proponents of narrativity, whose
writers are working out the same issues.

My latest writing project focuses on the Bowery, one block away from
my home, specifically the brief section between Cooper Union and
Houston, an area that contains the remnants of SRO hotels and the
remains of the 1890s Bowery that are slated to be demolished by The
Bowery Development Plan in the next decade. The artist coop that used
to be McGurk's Suicide Hall, named so because prostitutes used to
fling themselves out the windows, the Sunshine Hotel and various soup
kitchens will be extinct. The project is centered on documenting and
reacting to the layers of debris, including the human kind that layer
the streets. The intention is not to romanticize the suffering or
demonize the Bowery residents but rather to comment on poverty,
class, suffering and my own dilemma and identifications as a teacher
and poet one paycheck away from the street. It's the transparent
medium I walk through with my own poverty. Needless to say that for
me, the Bowery has taken on a metaphysical weight as a passage and
frame of mind as well as a power spot where ghosts and the nearly
living compete for space with the cell phonies who have come to
replace them.

I have failed at traditional forms but I suspect that in the long run
those forms have failed me. Maybe, maybe not. Each writer must make
and break her own rules. As for now, I'm at work observing,
discovering obsessions, and devising a container to carry it all in.



# Aja Couchois Duncan: However





## Notes on Narrativity - Writing in Prose


**Prior to my life as a writer,** I was a student of anthropology. I
still do not know exactly what this means, other than it is printed
on my college diploma. I do know that I am obsessed with what makes
us human and how this human configuration struggles to differentiate
itself from animal. This study of human is of course a study of self
and other, a study of self in family, a study of family as self.
However is about family, about the process of aging and the
injustices this culture (as if a singular referent could actually
take on so much meaning) inflicts on the old. However is an
ethnography of the last few weeks of my grandmother's life and her
shouting right back at me - you got it wrong and right, a little
right. However is in prose because this process of description is too
messy for a pretty mobile of string and glass. However is in prose
because prose is the viscous tissue of body and there is a lot of
body, its excrement, in this piece. However is in prose because, as
James Clifford wrote in the Predicament of Culture, "participant
observation obliges its practitioners to experience, at a bodily as
well as intellectual level, the vicissitudes of translation."
However is in prose because there is too much, rather than too
little, to say.

----

Not accounting for everything---who could---not just the alcohol and
the iron deficiency, but other failures as well. What happened
exactly. The itchy warmth of the car seat. The light from the house
across the way. My own need to itch and scratch and be done with it.
Of course this body no longer responds, I am earlier and inside taut
skin, two breasts. Even the car is not liquid of the body which fed
them, taught them how to walk into a nursing home and sign me up for
a cruise around the parking lot, my feet above the wheels of the
chair. As if a wheelchair could contain all that is inside of me.
Such structures remember nothing and I remember everything that
transpired. It is not the recollecting but how to frame it in what
they know.

I know they know nothing.

Real-estate is not a sure thing, I told them after the fires, but
they forgot. So now almost paralyzed and past speech I can only watch
them arrange things, moving the couch, replacing the tattered cloth.
Home is after all only a settling of dust. I cannot move, so dust
settles. Settling. They put me near the picture, underneath it, an
awkward likeness. Pointy nose, unfriendly hair. My hair, like many
things, is no longer mine. A purple haze about my head. How they
frame me.

The towel is rough and the shower too hot. Each time it is a
different nurse. Mrs. Gagnon, they scold when my legs buckle or a
rebellious ankle twists. They set me on the toilet to rest, each of
us exhausted by the eighty-three pounds of yield. The bathroom so
unlike my own and still I get lost between them. The girls think the
water angry and the grass along the yard just weeds. Everything was
planted with his own hands, large scaly trout even though he was
chicken legs and a crows fat beak. Mom, they say and try to bend my
elbow outside its range. They are making up, or evening out. Those
years I yelled and complained and wished them unhappy marriages and
thankless children. No need to wish such things, every one of them
cries themselves to sleep. Perhaps only now. Or after.

Clutching the pillow, my name across the breast. They know me as my
order in their birth, first generation, narrow fingers scaring an
uneven yellow embroidery, grandma it would say if it were legible,
granbra or jomda. The girls hold my arms, leather handles on the
suitcases they carry, satisfied with my containment. A body folded
into an origami crane and stuffed into the front seat of a car, my
car, now theirs. See mom, just a few blocks, not that different. They
think my silence not thought or post-thought as if counting was
beyond a brain once stroked. Each distance the length of my tongue
and I know they are lying, driving me outside my own frequency so
even the hairdresser will be lost and cannot mix the exact shade of
dusk that is my hair.
What injury can touch these few blocks, my home since before he died
and I roamed them like a doll house, my hooked body fitting perfectly
through each door.

Whose life so easily told as words. They think I am past me or they
hold me in their earliest versions so I am no longer part of
description, an obstacle even to the sight of family. Perhaps I am
these trees along the freeway dusty with carbon monoxide or the
eucalyptus behind the nursing home shedding. The body takes much
longer to break free of limbs, forgetting my other daughter's name

 






# Cory Frost: It's Bits World


 


## Working Notes

**The primary idea here** is that we have to forget where ideas come
from in order to find them interesting again. Non-English-speaking
poets of English will take a text-could be a phone book, could be a
love letter, could be the instruction manual for a pocket
fisherman-and create astonishing juxtapositions which in turn create
narrative fireworks in the mind of an ordinary, pre-programmed
English-speaking reader like me. "A comfortable twig for the heroine
in the town. I feel more refreshed than anyone. My daughter has
arrived at puberty." Their ability to do this rests on their
inability to remember or even understand the original context.

When the pervasive, mass-produced poetry of (culturally and
economically Imperialist) jingles, slogans, and catchphrases is read
through a filter of foreign-ness-either cultural or linguistic-what
results is something infinitely more imaginative and disruptive.
These mutant words and phrases are the visible residues of desire, in
that they are produced by the conjunction of the foreign-language
longing for the power of English, and the longing of the
English-speaking reader for the novelty of otherness. The name "Bits
World" is derived from the name of a Japanese stationery brand,
"Bits Goods\": notebooks bearing slogans such as \"I\'m an useful
and enjoyable stationery. Let's get along with me!\" The name also
describes the writing/performance techniques I've been experimenting
with. (I sometimes use the more academic-sounding moniker "discourse
collage.")

In performance, this piece is accompanied by travel slides collected
from second-hand shops: pictures of famous landmarks (Saint Basil's
Cathedral in Moscow), not so famous landmarks (anonymous obelisks on
the side of the highway), people at the beach, road signs in various
languages. There's a shot of a wooden Santa Claus cut-out surrounded
by palm trees, shots taken from buses and trains, shots of totem
poles and castles and flamingoes: typical scenes from the great
20th-Century-Enlightenment project of Tourism. The slides emphasize
with irony that this is not a travelogue or a visit to a picturesque
alterity: the piece attempts rather to remove the distance from
travel, thereby making the exotic obsolete. But the slides are also
meant to distract the audience long enough to make them think they
are listening to a story. Which, I admit, despite the disparate
origins of and inspirations for these sentences, they are.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

They were looking for a total transformation of mundane experience
into bliss. It had become necessary. The winter came fast and hard,
and it stayed a long time. The potatoes froze in the ground, there
was not enough wood for the stove, and the modem was too slow. There
was a war, and people were being asked to recycle aluminum. It was
the off-season. I am so sleepy right now, but I'll tell you
something: you should regard every anomaly as an opportunity to be
awestruck.

When she was a small child she found a dead pigeon beside the
railroad tracks, and later in the same place she found a dead
calculator. Her friend went to the hospital. His cornea was wrinkled
and it was making his eyelids stick together. It was the off-season.
He closed up the shop and went out in search of a sandwich and a
malted milk. "Oh God damn it for Christ\'s sake,\" he said. Love.
What was this thing that so many poets made such a fuss about? When
they first met, they stayed indoors all the time. He was agoraphobic
and she was afraid to be alone.

In those days everyone had a story to tell. Losing a toe to frostbite
or getting one's head stuck in a milk can. Outside, the streets were
dirty and cold. They needed distraction. They wanted to see
everything, so they would be distracted from everything else. He is a
man in fine fettle. He possesses a generous spirit, and she has nice
manners. She knew when she got up that morning it would not be an
ordinary day. They took a lot of things with them: it was not the
things they were trying to escape so much as the origins of things.
They had to forget where ideas came from in order to find them
interesting again. She justified the trip as "radical chemotherapy
for my cancerous soul."

All the hotels were filled with celebrities they didn't know. People
were eating their dinners alone in restaurants. The mountains were
dream-like and seemed smaller than she had imagined. On the side of
the highway there were farmers selling Kool-aid. The amusement park
employees were not amused. Of all the rides, the bus back to the city
was the one they liked most. There was a restaurant that served
nothing but insects, and another one that served only tofu. "Can you
drive a standard?" he asked. They drove a Chevy to the levee and
drove a Ford to the fjord. They tried to make themselves more
interesting by being interested in more things. Some of the maps had
to be stretched to make them fit. "You can\'t get there from here,\"
he said. "It seems like I can\'t even get here from here,\" she
replied.

Everywhere they went, the souvenirs had been made somewhere else.
"There are so many beautiful places in the world,\" she said. \"But
they are so disorganized." They couldn\'t picture themselves in any
tragic news reports, so when the boat was overcrowded and barely out
of the water, they didn't complain. The hotel room was exactly six
feet long by three feet wide by three feet high, and it had a TV. Oh,
I'm so drowsy. What should we do? Let\'s go for a stroll by the
river, for a change of pace. Do you want to see a movie? It seems
silly to go to a movie theatre. They called home and left messages
for themselves. When they found an internet caf they digitized
postcards and emailed them to friends. Tourism is the greatest gift
of the twentieth century, they thought. "The reason I\'m always
having fun," she said, \"is that I\'m doing what I like. I\'m the
happiest loser alive," she said. \"My specialty is nonchalance,\" he
said.

Ten miles out of the city they saw the most amazing sight they had
ever seen. A lifetime of unspoken, unconscious supplication was
finally rewarded. They were late getting back to the train station
and the train was already beginning to pull away. They called out for
it to stop so they could get on. The conductor said, do you have
tickets? Who are you? New man, new woman, feeling lucky to be somehow
caught up in this tedious, cruel, and inexplicable existence. New
woman, new man, carrying an old suitcase with 30 lbs of brandy-filled
chocolates and no spare underwear. Reading books upside-down and
backwards. Losing our wallets with a sense of purpose. Sleeping with
our eyes open. Haggling over hagiography, canonizing cartoon
characters. Boxing with St.Goofy. Paying for dinner with underarm
deodorant. Leaving a trail of discarded punctuation marks. Taking out
insurance and releasing it into the wild. Fucking on the carpet,
between the seats. I am a gentle philosopher of the road, he
proclaimed. I am the zeitgeist multiplied by a weltschmerz, she
declared. New man and new woman, picking up the pieces and moving on,
except sideways this time.

They played Scrabble in the observation car, by moonlight, with
blankets around them and strangers sleeping in the corners. They
passed a frozen waterfall. They found a newspaper and discovered that
there had been an election while they were gone. The war had moved on
to a different part of the world. The stars fizzled and went out. The
leaves were vivid in a way that made them feel light-headed. Sunrise
above the clouds doesn't compare with this, he admitted. \"It\'s
so... ineffable!\" she exclaimed. \"That exclamation mark,\" he
said, "that exclamation mark is the last exclamation mark you\'ll
ever need."

Two people are travelling on a train. Watching tiny villages and
fields go by, having sex in the washroom. "It\'s bits world,\" she
says. It's bits world. Let\'s get along with me. I am an edifying
and enjoyable text-based performance artist, and this is most
comfortable performance you have ever run into. Wherever you may be,
whoever you are, when you think of usefulness, think of Bits.

Soaring and diving with the aquarium sharks and casting another

desire to paint without making a picture. This was the first story

they muttered attempting to get on with things. But all that was
construed as thing had reverted to sky at the slightest glance,
embarrassed sky.

## Working Notes

**I had been holding a vase** in my hands that now lay shattered on the
floor. The vase was "the novel." I'm not sure of the force that
knocked the whole away from me but I imagine that it was a slow
accumulation. As I looked down at the pieces, I could not see how
they ever fit together. In one place lay prose, in another narrative,
and off to the side, in several, lay the components of fiction. I
never felt that I was writing "fiction," so I was surprised to see
it there. What I found more difficult, however, was seeing "prose"
extricated from "narrative."

This confused me. Before this moment, I had thought of narrative as
the trajectory of language, as the direction in which it unfolds, and
of prose as narrative's rawest tone. But as I observed them lying
there, I saw each independent of the other. I knew that no matter
what I did, I would be writing narrative, but I could not fathom how
I wrote prose separate from that. The process is as natural as
breathing, however this crisis I experienced was emblematic of that
occasion where we catch ourselves in the mechanics of respiration and
get caught up in the mystery of that.

| *for Tisa Bryant*


A friend has pointed out a paralysis this evening, which she has been
ignoring for some time. The friend has had to ask why certain parts
of her body don't move, why there is failure in her language, why
she carries this failure in her body, making her body unable to move.
It is evening when the friend can no longer contain her observation
and is forced to point to this stillness that makes her a stranger in
the room.

The friend points to the paralysis.

Our immobile one is sitting quietly in the corner of a room staring
at a glass of milk, seemingly enmeshed in daydream. There is
condensation on the glass, an indication that the milk has sat
unattended for too long.

Earlier, the friend brought the immobile one this milk.

Then paralysis took its form.

---Now she has been made to see her paralysis. It impresses her and
makes her mad. She and the friend sit in the room mad at the
paralysis. As the milk grows warm.

The friend looks at the milk and asks to sip it. Our one says,
please.

Now that the paralysis has been exposed both women stare ravenously
at the milk.

Both reach for the milk.

"Now that I've pointed this out to you, can you explain how it got
there?"

She answers.

"Does the measurement, though compelling you into silence, serve the
companion in anyway? Is a co-habitation possible?"

Again, she answers, this time with more emphasis on each word.

"I have known you for ten years," the friend says placing her chin
in her hand, amazed at what she's seeing.





# Gad Hollander: From *Serialscribbler*


 


## Working Notes

*Serialscribbler* (as the title suggests) is an ongoing work, so far
only in prose, though there's no rule about that. It started a
couple of years ago, when I sent out a piece of scribble on a
postcard every day to someone I knew around the world. The texts were
continuous (a lot of drivel thrown in) but each recipient only
received a fragment. The idea was to re-integrate other people's
(not necessarily writers or artists of any description) responses in
my own writing. So far, that hasn't happened, and after some 120
postcards I stopped sending them out, especially as the internet
seems to throw a slightly anachronistic twist on the project. For the
time being, then, it's still an open-ended project and anything
might happen with it.

From some working notes on Serialscribbler found in my notebooks
from the last few years:

The language eludes me just as I step into it. I do not have the
power to seize it, let alone transform it.

Serialscribbler---what is more than language in it---
now sit in Waterloo station
now hear & be tempted to bark
but not bark, quarantine---look up "bark\"---
then & now reconciled (thru fog)---may as well not pay & suffer the
consequences---what if someone gets up & leaves in the middle of a
word---how do we find the middle of a word---if poetry is an
approximation, the world is a wild guess---guests come & go, trains
depart & arrive, film rolls.

Snatch scribbler---between picking up dog shit & chasing after the
puppy, the memorable phrase or fragment might fall into place. More
likely it will not. Take in the decent weather while it lasts---a day
or two---then brace yourself for the onslaught of dark winter days.

Write without closure, as if each block of text were a prelude to
the soundwork or video. Take it one sense at a time and then
return--- not quite, but in a spiralling form rather than a circle---
serialscribbler.

### "the natural suspicion of words"

Sometimes it happens that even Serialscribbler, who by definition is
busy at all times if not totally self-absorbed to the point of
oblivion, sometimes (I say) it happens that Serialscribbler will
devote some attention to another experience, eg, reading a
stranger's book or looking at a sculpture, even feeling it to gain
some tactile experience of it.

I write in prose by default . I don't know where to break the line
in free verse and I don't like having the line-lengths predetermined
by fixed verse forms. It's an interim solution. I write in prose but
think in poetry.

**I took editor to one side** and had a quiet word with him. This is for
my own good, I whispered, and proceeded to disable his editorial
tools, lopping off his hands, extracting his tongue, etc. He seemed
to understand and, as I now read it, thanked me profusely with his
lolling head and rolling eyes. Then I began to practise my fiddling,
keeping an eye on his writhing body while folding, turning one word
into another the way dough is turned before being given time to rise.
I dredge up the analogy (more fiddling) with a tinge of regret, even
shame, for bread is my favourite food in all the world---I suppose I
would kill for it---and to mention editor in the same breath as bread
seems almost blasphemous; ah, but I remember there's a limit to
words and it's just been reached. So let\'s step back a step,
retract that near-blasphemous breath, inhale deeply, say: I fiddle is
to say I scribble within the confines of my own space, despite the
neighbours' persistent complaints about the screeching and
scratching, their calling in the police who, in any event, are
powerless to stop me fiddling when I explain that the noise is just a
scribbling, a turning of one word into another in the manner of
kneading dough, careful to point out that I'm not inciting any
revolutionary acts by invoking the analogy and, at the same time,
carefully keeping editor out of view lest he give the wrong
impression or, perhaps, because I'm ashamed of him. Upon leaving the
police shake my hand---I've always had a way with the police, as one
has with children or animals---and I resume my fiddling. Editor is
hurt, professionally and physically, and since this has just been
established as his necessary condition, we are now both faced with a
steep learning curve which we need to get used to, each in his own
way.

I am no virtuoso, it must be said, and fiddle only because I'm
curious; my fiddling is spurred on by a vague desire to discover the
new sounds rather than improve or polish the old ones. That's not to
say I don't appreciate the old ones, much in the way editor does,
but it's not enough to fulfil my desire. Editor, in contrast, has a
way of expunging the new sounds with a stroke of his pen, somewhat
like an abortionist, fossilizing them before they ever take flight.
He believes my desire is misguided, that there is a better way of
channeling and controlling it, that it should be put to better use.
While he was fit and able he'd always wanted to have a virtuoso at
hand (forgive the expression) and had dreamed of making me one of his
own. Ah, but there are too many virtuosos, cried Robert Schumann,
spitting on the polished parquet floor. Editor is confounded by the
riposte. I can see his mangled body, thinking: surely you mean
virtuosi. He is certainly not humming a melody inside his head,
because as I snatched the pen and disabled him I discovered, to my
shock, indeed my shame (after all, he is/was my editor), nothing in
his internal makeup remotely connected with music. Instead there were
millions of micro-blueprints stacked on top of each other, slightly
curled at the edges like wafers, each bearing the imprint of some
formula for a melody, past or present or future: all nuts and bolts
and intricate scaffolding, which in its way presented a dazzling
construction that any virtuoso would have given his right arm to play
(forgive the expression), but without the slightest indication of
what voice or tone or timbre such melodies might be borne upon. In
fact, a moment before disabling him I informed editor that there are
no more virtuosos in the world, only students, and to my surprise
(and eased conscience) he seemed more relieved than disturbed by the
news. I was not telling him the whole truth, of course, but our
relationship is such that it forgoes the elaboration of truth (on my
part because its structural complexities would be overbearing, while
on his part the aesthetic and moral dimensions would defy his
comprehension); rather the smallest grain of truth is often enough to
maintain the fragile rapport between us. So for the moment editor and
I live side by side, reconciled to each other's exclusionary habits;
I fiddling, he nodding his wobbling head, keeping time for the sake
of appearances. Occasionally, when our respective tasks come full
circle and we turn a mutual glance of recognition towards each other,
we will take a break together over a cup of coffee or a glass of
wine, our dreams oozing incoherently from the corners of our mouths,
dripping like bird shit on the cafe table, as life flows to and fro
on the pavement before our eyes---his, like mine, darting back and
forth with unabashed lust as one young woman or another comes into
view---only to have our little reveries promptly interrupted by a
waitress asking, "Are you all right, sir?\" So that I\'m forced to
look up and around me, awkwardly, desperately. Editor has suddenly
absconded and left me to answer her simple query. In a futile attempt
to grasp a pen with my mouth and scribble "yes\" on any scrap of
paper, I have, not for the first time in my life, accidentally
overturned the table and chairs. Remorse for my reprehensible
behaviour towards editor momentarily seizes me, and a shameful tear
is about to fill my eye as the waitress, brimming with kindness and
efficiency, comforts me: "Don\'t worry, sir, it\'s all right.\"
Dutifully she bends down and shuffles on all fours as she cleans up
the mess around my truncated legs; her breasts, liberally exposed to
my parched and crippled gaze, sway slightly with her scrubbing
movements, as if to say: drink, drink my compassion, o scribbler.

As a student of fiddling I am prone to daydreaming, especially when I
practise my bowing and fingering, which I do religiously yet by all
accounts hopelessly, for whether I practise once a week or every day
of the week, whether I fiddle on street corners or in cafés or in the
privacy of my room, the result is always, acoustically speaking, a
scribble. It has to do with distraction, of course, and the
enticement offered up by an image of loveliness passing by on the
street, in a café, or across the walls of my room. Oh, but I like
that, remarks a progressive tutor, a specialist on expressionism, his
ear ever alert to the permutations of the new sounds. Annoyingly, I
must watch my posture at all times---me, a cripple, watch my
posture!---make sure my eye-line does not stray too far from the
strings, and always keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. Such,
at least, were the rules given at the outset, when I was a mere
sub-scribe, long before I became a student, and although I'm now at
post-graduate level the same rules still apply, the cardinal one
among them being "never drift into mindless reverie.\" The trick, as
another tutor advised us, is to dream without affecting a dreamer's
countenance, to cast one's mind off in some direction while the
(very same) mind stays focused, enrapt by the intricacies of the
hands' manoeuvres. As you can see, I haven\'t given up yet, perhaps
because I've noticed that over the years tutors come and go, experts
become fallible, if not completely discredited, histories get
revised, wars start up and arrive at their conclusions, stores change
ownership, buildings get torn down and re-built, and things generally
move on---whereas scribbling just evaporates into the atmosphere like
so much vacuous sighing and, despite its noxious fusion with the air
we breathe, is accepted as just another waste product with a
tolerable, low-level health risk, no more dangerous than the toxins
given off by other human wastes. The fact that nobody pays any
attention to it, however, could prove tragically fatal under certain
circumstances---for example, if a scribbler were to be retroactively
regarded as talented, even a genius, and we, human kind, belatedly
berated ourselves for having been so deaf, so blind, and beat our
breasts with futile lamentations, and tore each others' hearts out
with proprietary fingernails, and waged suicidal wars in the name of
said dead scribbler, now canonised, his or her pen emblazoned on the
national pennant billowing proudly over our burning libraries, day
and night, etc. But in the case of students, even at post-graduate
level, such potential catastrophes are highly improbable, as unlikely
as a cataclysmic end of days, so there's really no need to fret, no
need to get anxious over our performance, no need (or indeed desire)
to seek encouragement from our peers or advice from experts, because
scribbling is merely a process, nothing more, a perpetual practice
session with or without a fiddle, and in any case, as otologists have
shown, the human ear's threshold for noise rises by the hour, edging
nearer to a level of infinity with every exclamation, every grunt and
moan, every scratch or tap of the finger, with every etched
apostrophe or comma on a blank page. As one of our most distinguished
tutors put it: *Our potential capacity to listen to everything will
shake the foundations of our belief systems to their core.* I was
thinking, as it happened, about the word as the foundation of faith
(not my original thought, just pondering an old one) when he added:
*It's something we should consider with the utmost gravity and
tackle with a measured rationality.* I think he was soft peddling
doom, imploring us to reinstate a more humane threshold for the
ear's intake of noise before it\'s too late. Too late for what, I
wanted to ask, eager to join the debate. But being a cripple, being
doomed to my studies, playing uncontrollably with my fiddle, I would
have been unable to get my point across to him, over there, on stage,
behind the podium, without upsetting the furniture and provoking a
riot. All the same, upon leaving I reflected that despite my
restraint it was an interesting outing for a bleak winter's
afternoon, and I went away believing that my knowledge had increased
by two- or threefold.

Although I'm sometimes mistaken for a cripple, sometimes I\'m not.
It is therefore just as true to say that I am as that I am not a
cripple, and it's a matter of political interpretation whether you
believe one or the other of these truths. My identity as a scribbler
has not been affected one way or the other in this respect, but this
is probably due to the perverse social conventions of our time. In
the old days they would have certified me, put me in a safe place
behind walls for my own good, and said no more about the matter;
invisible, I would have been perceived as either happy or unhappy.
Today our techniques are more subtle and sophisticated, especially in
the free world, where we take pride in the fact that we can air these
issues openly and hold interesting debates at our local cafés or on
television or occasionally even on a bus, on the way home from work,
though that is still somewhat rare owing to our collective fatigue
after work. But those of us who don't work, who are less weary, will
not hesitate to launch into such democratic debate if we should come
upon a fellow non-worker on the bus, even heading home at 5 a.m.
after an all-night party, just when our fellow workers are setting
off to work on that bus, though they may not be sufficiently awake to
participate in the debate and are possibly too preoccupied with their
night's dreams, reconstructing the details, thinking of plausible
explanations for implausible events, half-consciously tying together
random associations in their minds, their hands struggling to support
their drooping yawning heads, their bleary eyes peering into the
pre-dawn darkness as they silently ask themselves what does this or
that object mean in that incongruous setting, among such unlikely
people, and is the dream object connected with the real thing they
stumbled upon only a few days earlier, after not having seen the
likes of it for years, their brains persistently searching through
this miasma of vague objects and people for some kind of solution, a
key, as if these freshly painted dreams were riddles that only needed
the correct answer to facilitate a stress-free day at work and allow
them to confront their superiors with the confidence of people who
know themselves, whose selves have been revealed to them in dreams,
regardless of how menial their jobs might be and irrespective of
their professional status, their pecuniary position, their grooming
or their physical appearance in general---it being their democratic
prerogative, theoretically, to be themselves in any guise they
choose---because they saw the light through the dusk and, having
opted out of a now raging democratic debate, heard a voice in the
wilderness and were born again on the upper deck of the bus at 5a.m.,
en route to work. I know all this for a fact because, having
participated in that democratic debate, I witnessed their revelations
with my own eyes and quickly scribbled everything down while it was
all fresh in my mind, when their dreams were far less obscure than
they are today.

Since then reverie has been my precise goal, and my fiddling studies
are only a means of dealing with the pragmatic side of other
dreamers' dreams. One fine day, as we return from our afternoon
ritual of ogling nymphs on the banks of the boulevard, editor and I
will come upon a list of words posted on our door, with a set of
instructions to consider their place in my scribbling. Editor is keen
to proceed, sensing an opportunity to regain the high ground in our
relationship, but I remind him of our pact and avert his deployment
for the time being. He is all but dead, a mere copyist, but I too am
suddenly paralysed by a bout of amnesia, my lifelong years of study
failing me miserably. Conscientiously I copy the list into my
computer and it comes out like this:

Shame

The private

The secret in narrative writing

Representations of time

Event

Expectation (the future) in narrative

My computer (or rather its editor) automatically capitalizes the
first word in each line---not what I expected, but I leave it as it
is. I imagine the software writer will claim responsibility, perhaps
a former poet eager to accommodate traditional verse writers. But,
capitalized or not, the words are easily comprehensible, so I feel at
least partially redeemed by my scribbling studies, imagining that any
reader would understand them: the typography and size of a word has
no bearing on its meaning, I remind editor, though it may be argued
there's a difference in degree. Though I would have preferred the
initial words without capitals, it seems pointless (and too
difficult) to change them now. (Perhaps in future the software
writer, a being of necessity in the future, will include an
instruction that would allow the computer's editor to distinguish
between a list of items and lines of verse; perhaps another
instruction might be added that would allow its editor to discern a
writer's intended nuance for a given word, or line, and
automatically capitalise such words---for example, "life\" as typed
in by an immortal's fingers.) But this is beside the point. The
point is I don't understand why or how language and writing coexist,
though I understand and to some extent sympathize with the historical
expediencies that have conjoined them. But how, after so many
thought-bearing hours in such claustrophobic proximity, have they
failed to find their separate autonomous domains? Have they just
grown used to each other and learned to be mutually tolerant? Have
they gone a step further (backwards, it seems) and learned to
coexist, perhaps even to love each other in our thought processes? If
that were so---though I don't for a moment believe it---why? what
for? We scribble, day in, day out. If we advance, writing lies in
wait, ready to devour us; if we retreat, language stabs us in the
back. Would it not be better if we had neither---no language, no
writing---if there were no scribbling, no anti-scribbling, no pauses
and deliberations over their duration, if everything were simply a
constant torrent of some alien construct pouring into the well of
truth, that shameless metaphor born from the union of language and
writing. I'm not alone in this my bafflement. My incomprehension is
borne out by the writers I read, writers who have nothing to do with
language, who don't know the meaning of the word, writers as removed
from representations of time, event, expectation and futures as Greek
shards, who have as little idea about shame, the private, the secret
in writing as that extrovert Yaweh, who have never even heard of a
narrative concept. Those writers I read, those are the writers I
write, that is, those writers I re-write; that's why they write and
why I write, why we, they and I, write, tuning our scribbling fiddles
to a sorrowful pitch. Editor reads the very same writers I write, and
yet invariably incinerates their pages, marking every word for
approval before burning them, and sometimes adding a last-minute
grammatical correction in his head. But editor reads only what has
already been written, texts, what may never be re-written, that's
impossible, what may only be read over and over and over. Whereas I
and the writers I read write only to re-write each other and will not
allow ourselves, for our verbs are many, to be re-written otherwise,
distracted by a shopping list of contingencies with moral and
historical imperatives, since we're ambitious to succeed our
scribbling with our failure. That shopping list belongs in my pocket.
It is revealed (like a furtive cigarette in the street) when I go
shopping and use language as a counter, when I'm talking face to
face, seeking out your immediate reply, my lips smacking each other,
my jaws moving like pincers, my tongue slithering between movements
of jaws and lips, my vocal chords dilating or contracting like
synchronized swimmers, my lungs and every other pertinent organ
acting in time and with deceptive ease to allow me to articulate
something or other, this or that. Thus we talk and act, sometimes
sequentially, sometimes synchronously. The articulation of our bones,
as well as what we concoct with language, says something about our
life, in death, after the flesh has rotted away and the worms have
moved to another body, yet language itself can never exhume the
writing that went on (perhaps on a daily basis) before the final
heartbeat. While the writer, o scribbler, is steeped in shame, in
some perverse privacy or in the self's profoundest secret, the body
of writing is perpetuated in its own skin, marking out its own
as-ifness the way silence delineates the borders of language. Let us
admit, let's say, that I have murdered you and am now stricken with
remorse, dumb with shame and crippled by guilt; whatever I've done,
whatever else I'm doing, I am not writing. I am outside the writing,
doomed to carry in my language as author some pitiful mental
inflammation throbbing with a succession of phonemes, each in turn
having been orphaned by its murderous language, the same that suckled
it, that gave it comfort in the face of silence. Which is all well
and good, is as it should be in the realm of as-if, but as the
writing proceeds what if, scribbling, it revealed itself in some
sacred alphabet, a revelation earmarked as a future holy text, as
though writing were shame and privacy and secrecy itself, to be
divulged in our death? And what if that as-if were an angel,
classical, orthodox, with the power to unleash language's ultimate
terror---though I and the writers I re-write don't know what that
might be---would editor allow it to fulfil its divine mission, or
would he intervene and, effectively, overthrow the lord in our
household? Such questions seem infinitely difficult when, of an
afternoon, editor and I return from viewing the maidens by the river,
slightly tipsy from their beauty.

I like, I say to him before reaching our door, a poetry that is
definitive in its ambiguities, but cannot be as passionate about it
as I am about a poetry of ambiguous definitions. Reaching for the
list of words on the door, he calls me a hypocrite.

I was so ashamed that, if writing were language, "so\" would never
survive under the burden it claims to support, for shame draws us
back through time, as even the earliest scribblers evoking Paradise
were at pains to point out, and during that interregnum every act of
love and war perpetrated by the species has accrued to its surface.
Since writing is not language, however, it is easy to articulate the
so of it, to say it or spell it or memorize it for future use. And I
hid, editor confessed to me once, for I was so naked.

The nonsense we tolerate, I confessed back to him in a moment of
compassion, is nothing compared to the nonsense we produce,
especially when the latter is predicated by a collective pronoun and
dressed, how can I put it---I paused, I scratched---aphoristically?
he offered.

# Eileen Myles: Long and Social



 


**My book** (*Cool for You*[^2_myles_note1]) is absolutely an
extension of my poetry practice, I've even come to refer to it and
maybe the class of novels it's a member of as the poet\'s novel.
Having written a novel I don't have to protect myself from the
disparaging term poet--yet I\'m more clearly a poet than ever. I
mean a poem is an extravagant grandiose and trembling form, for
better or worse always alive, I think, and I've brought those
weaknesses and virtues into novel writing and I'm dying to do it
again. As a younger poet I was urged (in order to be important) to
think large, to write the long poem, but I think this is it. It's
epic poetry in the sense that the epic poem is a communal form, and
long and social. I wrote it for you. That's what the title means in
a way. I know there's a more technical definition for epic poetry
but that seems the best way to get it wrong. I'm more interested in
what Joyce Carol Oates did in **Blonde** than Seamus Heaney's prize
cow. Poets should write novels en masse and reinvent the form and
really muck up the landscape. I often think of Leslie Scalapino
telling me that her long book the return of painting, etc. was called
a novel because a novel means you start at the beginning and you read
to the end. It was a way to guarantee she could be read differently.
I don't care about that particular aspect, the front to back thing
but being read differently of course is nice. Time is my real subject
and calling a book a novel immediately adjusts the reader's
perception of time.

My book is shuffled if you take the long view. When I started to
write the first chapter which was a story, the whole thing is a story
for me, it occurred to me that a novel could just be all these
stories shuffled, and I thought of books I loved long ago, Julio
Cortazar's Hopscotch. I read that book straight through, but I read
it differently knowing that he had that chart at the front suggesting
you could alternately read it this way, and that the book could
permute all these different ways. I'm in love with the form of the
novel being molten, not putting the power of reordering in the hands
of the reader but to extend to the reader a sense that the form of
the book is as accidental as life. It's studied, damn studied, the
cool casual life as is the cool casual novel, but as accidental as
say the zabruder footage. Some guy happened to be there with his
camera, and as it turns out history was made. As it turns out he gave
us our only window onto that day in Dallas. When one realizes that
John Clare inadvertently gave us the first No Trespassing signs in
literature you realize bumpkins must write first, not last.

One more note on that---everything's visual and in even or
especially in advertising the oddly cropped shot is what's used.
Literature as it's sold today is so backwards. Hand held literature
is of course what I'm selling. It\'s not a memoir, it\'s a
recording. And even purporting to be a bad recording at times. As a
female writer the pose of awkwardness is very dangerous though
because at this post feminist moment one should be a top, one should
win etc. But female in history is ground down, anonymous, untold.
That's the story that\'s interesting.

And another thing: more poet's novel. In **Chelsea Girl\'s** \"My
Father's Alcoholism\" was the story where I stretched myself, and
tried to write out of pools and see how they would build. I just
literally go into a room (one labeled my father's alcoholism) and
begin inventorying the memories, the substance of the memory, the
materiality of it. The fur of childhood, not the feelings. When I was
done with one I would wait and let another one grow. It really is
like walking in the rain. Can that generate a narrative,or a
narrative feel? It sure works in movies. But movies have the dark on
their side. My hope is that by being as solipsistically in my mind,
downloading erratic shaped drops and letting some momentum build on
that order, rather than an order based on action, you can kind of
reverse our assumptions about activity. Or maybe I mean self.
There's a beautiful math to it, like music if you just let yourself
go and describe the experience of your life like it's some public
spectacle you are privy to and you‚ re waiting for the music of the
information along with everyone else. I feel less alone when I tell
my most private stories than any other time. This does link up to
performance. When you are acting or even reciting a text you wrote
and you're on a darkened stage under a pool of light there\'s a
terror as you're singing along with the text, its like driving, that
moment at night when you think shit I could just pile into the
opposite lane and that would be it. The self could just smash into
the light and dark and be gone forever. So you feel contained within
the details by that sense of danger and that provides the tension
while you proceed lavishly downloading "me\" in every ribbony way I
can imagine.

The limitations of "New York School\" have been what Frank did, what
John does, are you like Jimmy. Mustn't forget Kenneth or Barbara.
It's like Mt. Rushmore. You can say some quick thing about them
all---it's chatty abstraction, it\'s American speech, and I\'ve
learned different things from all of them but since they are just
people I think it's tone that people wind up miming, or concerns
rather than electricity, the weight and pause and incredible expanse
of the exploring mind in speech. I discovered what I sound like long
ago and of course I go where they wouldn't and couldn\'t so it\'s
sort of like explaining why you prefer not being a corpse. New York
school mimed is worse than academic, it's like my dad being a
mailman coming home with the Ivy League clothes from the Harvard
dorms where he had his route. You have to blow that up pretty quickly
but it's just sad. Let\'s face it, they were just as New critical as
everyone else in the fifties. They all would assert the poetry was
not about them. It's about skimming the surface of the self. Using
that facility to shape the poem. My dirty secret has always been that
it's of course about me. But I have been educated to believe I\'m no
one so there's a different self operating and I\'m desperate to
unburden my self of my self so I'm coming from nowhere and
returning. That's sort of classic. You just cannot underestimate the
massive difference in writing out of female anonymity. It blows all
the styles out of the water.

I think the form of the novel gives dignity to my shame. Sometimes
I'm just ashamed to block the sun. Performance, and I include
readings in that, makes the body be the container for the work. It is
when you write the words of course. The body always seems like the
shame. The camera must cut away to the trees, the animal is telling
too much. The animal doesn't want to die etc. If you\'ve ever sat on
a panel when some people read and some people speak directly the
difference in those two deliveries in terms of the room's
interaction with the speakers is immeasurable. The dangerous loose
canon is *how* we conduct public life---we want to stifle the stray
remark and we want to house it. I'm totally translating that impulse
into a several hundred page thing, my sorrowful body is now text.
It's like a zoo.

One last thought. In the **Times** there's occasionally these
articles where the great artist, Brice Marden or whoever takes us
into the met to see the work that is interesting to them. I started
reading Robert Smithson a couple of years ago and his move out of the
studio helped me understand the poet's situation, having no such
institution to tour through, having no **Times** to conduct the tour
in, and possibly being invisible because of that. Smithson yearned to
kick free of that structure that has been happily plunked down ever
more solidly. It seems like a novel is the only way to prove I was
here. Exactly how I was here. It's a social poetic invention.

# Daniel Nester: God Save My Queen (The Freddie Fragments)



 


## Working Notes

> "Mr. Narrator, this is Bob Dylan to me.\" 
> 
> --- D. Boon, The Minutemen, "History Lesson-Part II\"

**In June 2000**, I had a crisis. In a club called "Fun,\" an dank,
empty club deep in Chinatown, I sat down for an interview for the VH1
show SoundAffects, and talked about how Queen changed my life.

I left so much out in that interview that I tried to write more
poems about Queen, but hit a wall. Call it problems with
verisimilitude, whatever it was, poems weren't doing the trick.

So I started writing a confessional book, freeing myself from what I
think are very real aesthetic contraints on today's poem. The result
is a kind of prose poem, with narration leading to definitive moments
where I think my history and the object of my obsession's
history-and I say this with a straight face-intersect.

## God Save My Queen (The Freddie Fragments)

The day I bought the *Flash Gordon* soundtrack, the cashier, whom I
knew to be in a shitty suburban punk band, offered me my first record
store clerk snide comment.

"Nice bass line,\" he said, looking down at the banana yellow album
on the counter, punching up the price.

I walked away, meek and ashamed that my purchase had not passed
muster. He was, of course, referring to the single-note bass line in
"Flash\'s Theme,\" the single from on the soundtrack. But I was
steamed. It was one of those times you think of with the perfect
comeback later that night, and you lay there, beating yourself up for
not coming up with it at the time.

In 1977, when Queen were recording *The News Of The World,* legend
has it that the Sex Pistols were recording in an adjacent studio. Sid
Vicious, wandering into the wrong room, as was his custom, came upon
Freddie Mercury, sitting at a piano. His customary four fingers of
vodka in hand.

"Ah, Freddie Mercury,\" Sid said, proud of his recognition.
"Bringing ballet to the masses then?\"

Freddie looked up from the keys, and, not missing a beat, offered his
reply.

"Oh yes, Mister Ferocious. Well, we\'re doing our best, my dear.\"


## *Prophet's Song*


| Chunky on the shag rug
| I'm looking for my anthem
| I'm looking for my headphones
| I'm looking for the bare spot
| On the rug to wallow side-
| Stepped on the chair-stopped
| Door, and as I blast my ears
| Out with *A Night at the Opera,*
| I'm looking at pictures of you
| My catholic princes, my mother
| Father proxy, I'm in London
| With you now, the koi pond, the flamingo,
| The statues, the hymnal,
| The Aretha Franklin song at the funeral,
| Alone on a pew, watching the water,
| Watching the bare spot on the rug
| Filled with pictures on the floor,
| I'm ignoring the knocks on the door
| I'm ignoring the knocks on the door
| Stepped and stripped on the chair-
| Stopped door, I'm listening, listening.

The Elektra butterfly, an indicia, the small caps Helvetica bold      
font, the import Parlophones, their spare blank small writing. Those  
first few moments playing the English 12-inch singles, fresh from the 
thick plastic seal, realizing the beginning is too slow, that you     
have to switch the RMP knob from 33 to 45. The silence between the    
songs, readjusting in my chair, preparing for the first listen.       
Rooting for them, noting who wrote which track, soaking up the        
essence of each of them while listening to their song. And the order, 
the plot that album took, the lead-off rocker, the last song on side  
2's power ballad. The internal band politics I imagined in the       
making of that order. The Greek lettering in a concentric dance on    
the cheapo compilations.                                              

---

When I think of the 1980s, when I think of the skinny ties, and the   
big hair, teal drawstring pants, and Ronald Reagan, I think of Queen, 
of course, and how, shifting to their big synthesizer singles, they   
would graft a medley of past songs on the end of extended versions.   
Or how their videos for these songs had montage footage of concerts   
all over the world, all of which I found lame. I've come up with     
three possible reasons:                                               

1. A retrospective impulse, not provided by the rock literary        
establishment.                                                        

2. New digital tinkering, combined with a desire to make             
connections within their own work, combined with the finest cocaine   
and vodka human beings can afford, a few way overdue divorces, and    
a general lack of interest in the current song at hand, pressure      
from EMI and Capitol to pad out singles with no non-album B-sides.    

3. Because they can. They're Queen, the greatest fucking rock band  
there ever was or ever will be, and they can do whatever the hell     
they want.

Sometimes I feel the need to summon the ghosts of the 70s crowds
around me, or maybe they come to me. These ghosts appear as people I
meet by chance, people who actually saw Queen in concert.

Adding insult to injury, these people usually have seen them, like,
four, five times. I'll corner them, say, at a barbeque, ask
him---it's always a guy---a battery of questions.

'What songs do you remember,\' or, \'What was Freddie wearing\"
might be lead-offs. I move on to set lists, how they sounded.
Inevitably, these people tire of my inquiries, and run back to their
wives.

Once I bought a cherry copy of *Live Killers* at a church yard sale
in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The man who was selling them
also had a box set, *The Complete Prestige Recordings of Miles
Davis.* Got it for ten dollars. The Queen album cost 50 cents.

My new copy of *Live Killers,* the one with all four members onstage,
with arms raised receiving adulation from the crowd, had four photos
inserted inside one of the albums' slots. I remembered how I used to
stick girly photos inside an album I had designated for this purpose,
to retrieve them in private moments.

The dates on the back of the photos were 1979, the year the album
came out. In one picture, a guy is grabbing a blonde girl's bare
tits from behind, cupping them. In another, the same guy, his faint
brown mustache rides an ear-to-ear smile. His pants are completely
down. The third and fourth document the amount of coke the two had in
their private basement party. Both the boy and girl smiling, each
taking a turn snorting three and four-inch lines.

The way I find out about someone seeing Queen in concert is the
following. After my meek confession of my love for the band, after a
longer conversation about music, there's a set-up for the other
person to mention his own guilty generational pleasure. For instance,
he liked Styx at one time, he saw Journey once on the Escape tour.
Then, my reasoning goes, the path is made for me to say that my
favorite band is not some hip or critically acclaimed band, either;
that it is, in fact, Queen. It's like I\'m outing myself, and then
the guy--- always a guy---tries to console me, tells me about the
times he had seen Queen at concert. Then, I get to ask the battery of
questions. It's a safe framing for the information that I
mythopoetically need to hear. "They rocked the Garden or wherever,\"
or "they blew my mind, man,\" while off-hand remarks for some, is
music to my ears.

During one easy-going outing/concert re-creation session, I brought
up these found photos I found in the yard sale copy of *Live
Killers.* I was trying to spice up the conversation. I told him about
the pictures---the girl's tits, the guy\'s pants completely down,
the smiling pictures, the coke. We both laughed. I excused myself,
offering to buy him a drink at the bar.

When I came back to our seats, my recollect or muse had gone.

---



As if in my own benediction ceremony, I would lay out all of the
Queen albums, flush next to each other, in order of release, on my
bedroom floor. The 45s from each album would lay on top of them, in
the lower right-hand corner, also in order of release, from bottom to
top. I would then stand in front of this, drinking a wine cooler, as
if I were Noah in the *Ten Commandments* movie, congratulatorily
clasping my arms behind my back, as if this was my ark, my own
creation; that I had, through my sheer accumulation and arrangement
of these objects, some part of creating them. Actually, back then, I
am sure that I thought I had created them, at least in the form of
the configuration I was looking at, and the Bartles & James tasted
sweet going down my throat, and with my room clean and vacuumed, I
would lay on my bed, jerking off.

| It was at the Queenvention

Am I the biggest Queen fan? Certainly not. When I joined the Queen
International Fan Club in 1982, the newsletters were full of pictures
of fan club conventions, thousands of people taking weekend vacations
to watch videos, play trivia games, play tug-of-war, trade rare 45s.
All of this happened in exotic locations-Belgium, South America,
Brighton. Anywhere but America, it seemed. So I kept to myself with
my collection of 12 albums, 20 singles, and the few American rock
magazines that mentioned Queen at all. Then I would go out high
school parties, listen to Van Halen, new wave, Blondie 45s, Billy
Joel, and Phil Collins, as if that was the outside world, and my room
was another.

One afternoon in 1984, when my parents were out, I called the Fan
Club in London, using the phone number from the album jacket of *The
Works.* Ostensibly, I wanted to ask about my membership renewal, but
I also wanted to talk to someone else who actually liked my favorite
band. I would announce myself---"Hello from America!\" ---ask the
man who answers about the weather, if a band member had been around
that day. *Of course they hadn't,* I thought to myself, scoldingly.
But of course I had to ask: *the man on the phone being so much
closer to them.* Getting down to business, I inquire about my poster
and new fan club newsletter, which I had yet to receive.

I say something about how I feel like I'm the only fan in America.

"Would be nice to live in England, where everyone\'s a fan,\" I say,
mopingly. "Well,\" the English-accented man says on the other end.
"We did have another person from America send something in,\" he
says off-handedly.

"Really!\" I say. I am excited, panting. \"Who?\"

This could be someone I could correspond with, without running up my
parent's phone bill. Maybe, just maybe, it was a woman, killing two
birds with one stone: my love life and my cultural exile.

He looks up the person. "Yes,\" he said, flipping through papers.
"And that person\...that person\...is\...*you*.\"

Both of us paused at this, the brutal, Spinal Tap pity of this, the
newest single, "Hammer to Fall,\" failing to even dent the charts in
the U.S.

I don't think I ever felt so alone.


# Doug Rice: Because the Night,  from *Skin Prayers*


 


*"Because the Night\" was written out of a struggle to understand my
own uncertainties about gender and desire. For me, this battle has
always been sexual as well as religious. Traditional forms of
discourse-the memoir, realism, and so on-fail to engage in or express
this indeterminacy. I, thus, had to discover a language and syntax
that could express the confusion of the central character. I have
never believed in my own sex (that of a biological male) nor have I
felt that I am a woman "trapped\" inside the body of a man. This
queer space of my own "becoming\" demands different structures of
representation.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**As a child** I often awoke in the middle of the night startled by the
noise of blood in my body. Found myself lost inside burning dreams of
walking across the sands of the desert. Footprints dead in the wind.
Fingers pressed hard into my temples. I refused to believe in any of
this. This, my body. The stories told behind locked doors. Hungry to
be yours. Bare legs streaked by the cold air of winter in Pittsburgh.
This mistaken tongue began, without words, searching for the
derangement of some other body. Unfaithful words spoken aloud from my
mouth. Words, refused by gods and demons, thrown out against the dark
into strange bodies reflected on the bedroom wall. In the corner I
saw God standing in fire. There, I saw God. Silent. His awkward
elbows and jaw. An open invitation to my own mortality. In the
beginning before the flood of language my blunt fingers explored this
body, mine, which I had been ordered to ignore. Curious about the
torn skin at the precise moment when I came to know that God sees all
and follows me. Into the attic. I climb wooden stairs. God leaves me
forsaken, father places his hand on my shoulder but I only see a
reflection in the mirror of some dear dead memory. Feel his cold body
close behind me. His gray hand trembles against the beauty of the
mirror. My belly warm and soft. When I try to move, the ropes
tighten. Into me. My father cries. Spilling blood and skin onto the
hardwood floor. I fall down on my back. The weight of God holds me to
the earth. Paralyzed in time. In some countries this is the sign for
the awakening of love. My thighs like the threat of open scissors. My
lips tremble. Speak, why does he not speak? So much dust.

I was taught to fear monsters under my bed, bogeymen in the walls,
and angry angels hanging upside down from the ceiling. "They will,\"
Daddy told me, "bite off your toes and toss them into the
Monongahela River." Mother flicking and flicking the light switch.
Three times. Me begging her to turn off the lights. Be done with it.
She stood in the shadows of the doorway chewed away at her nails.
Between her teeth. Pulled them off her fingers. Spit them onto the
floor. In the morning my feet bleed. "The monsters will carry you
off to hell," mother warns me. \"In hell, you can\'t ever be a
girl." I keep my eyes open, wide-awake, deep through these godless
nights into mornings riddled by junk madness. In stillness, not a
breath, not a word of this to anyone. I wait never to speak for my
father to come home from work. Every minute, every night, I wait for
my father. He with his body uses his body. The one God had given him
at birth. In the name of his body, he interrupts my isolation. He
takes away my weariness. I never cry. Not once. I never shed a tear.
He likes that about me. I have heard that others have died because of
their tears.

Nine years old. 1966. The naked throat of a child. Cracked lips dry
and peeling. Born choking.

These guilty lips, mine, opening, stuck inside prayers of becoming a
girl. For my father. So that he need not use his fists so often. So
that his anger is more quiet. More gentle. Touch and let me touch
you. I offer him each desire of my body past before I became known as
a boy. She calls me her infant. But that is a dream, or it is years
later and we are in some parking lot in California. Her teeth are in
my collarbone, but this is my father. Now I lay me down to sleep.
Each night I lift my voice, whispering up at the plastic flesh of
Jesus nailed to a wooden cross. Forsaken body of childhood. Grace of
the Savior, my father. In his arms I want him to hurt me. To beat my
disobedient body into sudden desires and thrash my soul into some
unknown language. More. To want more. His knuckles in my blood. In
the image of. Stained hands and cold knees. I hope to be left alone
on some riverbank. Discarded. Abandoned beneath a bridge on the
Southside given over to the circle of homeless drunks sitting around
their fires. Their warm hands lighting my flesh. The burning prayer I
can not say. His lips on my lips her lips I remember. My back pressed
into the bark of a tree. Pray. This flesh, mine, my soul to keep,
haunted day and night by stunted freaks and biblical plagues. Locusts
near my eyes scratched their way into my dreams. The Lord. Never,
Grandma warned me, again and again, never look directly into the open
mouth of God. If I die in the eyes of God before I wake. Apologize.
Say it. You must. Say this, the cutting of your body, into words. My
sore mouth close to the feet of Jesus. A droplet of wounded blood,
perfectly round. Forgive me, Son of my Father. Pray without cutting
into your skin the Lord. No. I do not fear the boys in the
neighborhood. The ones spitting on street corners. I only fear
displeasing you. My soul this pain in here to take. Every single
night small men with dusty skin sneak through my bedroom window, wake
me from nightmares, from God's breath with their mad tales and
pointy fingers. Seven screaming horses. Their voices, pain escaping
from the shadows. Breathing their voices into my bones. I could not
see myself dressed in these clothes. Drunken nights on a boat. I
never did come to know their names, to understand how they had
traveled from the old country through the forest. Just one more
lonely night. Pinned and wriggling on the wall of a sawdust hotel.
These men with their uncontrollable betrayals mixing memory and
desire spoke in tongues of a world out past Babcock Boulevard.
Carried rumors to me of a land that was somehow not Pittsburgh. Me,
silent and still, in my barren bed all alone filled with waiting.
Glow-in-the-dark familial lines of blood being worn away by the
passing of each minute. My mother's alarm clock on the night stand
breaks into my bones. One by one. This rib then that one. Ticking my
body into a nightly ruin. My all alone, nearly dead eyes, squeezed
shut. Desires of my body unable to forget those foreign fingers
pressed into my neck. Those tiny men plucking my eyelashes. Each
morning, my eyes inside a pain of not wanting to see. Cramped
muscles. Hot and hard. Tendons torn out of joint. All night long. And
I wanted to be entered. Dreamt of being entered the way any woman can
be entered by any man. With the passion of Jesus wandering through
the desert, I tried to push my eyes back into my soul. Push my eyes
so deep down into the inside of me that I would make myself into
becoming blind. Wordless. Invisible girl in this decayed bed. The bed
that my grandmother escaped from sometime in the late 70s. She had
fled, screaming uncertain names, into the forest. Words flung loose
from between tight lips. White knuckles. I stared up at the
disappearing white of the ceiling, watched as God turned against
Satan, the teeth of Eve through the skin, believing that if I looked
hard enough beyond original sin then I could lift my body right out
of my bed through the ceiling straight into the sky. My hands balled
up into tiny fists. Frail fingers and prayers. Shouts into the street
at a disappointed God. Parasite girls in the far off and long ago
tugged at my lips. Sheets held to my chin. This throat, my memory of
speaking, raw and empty. Without a scream. His desire, mine. Her
fingers close to the secrets of lonely eyes. Bodies in motion but
never in flight. Perpetual motion. Once she had told me that bodies
at rest are compelled to remain at rest until another force acts upon
them. In them. Break me open. The other side her mouth. The making of
her will. Her forehead cracked the light. Wanting desire. Quiet.

Every night forgetful neighbors prowl around the shrubbery in our
backyard, try to steal glimpses of my body through the window. My
mother wants me to say in words why these neighbors circle our house
each night, fumbling around, kicking the dog, waiting their turn. She
wants me to explain my mouth to her. The meaning of life: to take it
in your mouth. Swallow. Close to dying. A death deeper than any
darkness visible. My mouth the slum of your wretched desires. You
break my teeth with your lies. Cut the corner of my mouth with a
knife. You are that big. I lift the blinds, stare outside at these
neighbors. The ones with all their eyes, trapped, looking in at me.
Blinking through the blindness, I search their bodies for signs. The
window locked shut. My mother seals the inside and the outside of my
window with fresh caulking every day and night. She checks the nails
she has hammered into the wooden frame of the window. Making certain
that the window could never be opened. No air. Just to breathe. A
breath. Outside, leaves moving. Concrete. The twigs of trees like the
scratched bones of my soul. Soiled underwear. The mud of the river of
my father. I keep my knees locked together and beg God to find my
body unharmed. Forgive me my fingers. My belly warm beneath. Rising
to his touch. Skin ripped through by the beginning, in the making of
desires. I smell you on my body, Father. I say my word against your
suffering. Try to make noises. I say your name. You refuse to hear my
voice. Under your mouth. Say my name. You, then, enter me like a
clumsy foreigner seeking a new home in unfamiliar streets. Your
desire penetrates me here and there and here, again and again, until
my own name becomes incomprehensible to me. Every night my father
dreams. Sometimes his dreams make him speechless. Quiet mornings
listening to the radio report the weather, traffic, sports, news. My
mother moves from room to room turning on every light in the house.
Even the flashlights. The nightlight in the hall.

My father sits at the kitchen table sweating. The dead of winter and
still my father sweats. Nearly dies twice from heat exhaustion.

Day after day my sister stays alone in her bedroom. She is no longer
one of us. She has abandoned hope and become an invisible memory.
Divided by two. Tin soldiers and Nixon coming. In the summer of 1979
she burned all her books. Said she would become a vegetarian
mathematician with an attitude. Would disprove every single idea that
Einstein had ever conceived. E=mc2, my sweet ass, she said every
single night at dinner. My father would slap her across the face with
his hard bones and make her go to her room for the night. Running
down the hall, she would scream that she, from this day forth, would
only have sex with animals. Only consent to wild, senseless fucking.
Sudden and random.

At night, this father's body became another anonymous encounter with
my flesh.

The dried, flaking skin of my fingers. Rotten flesh. Have you ever
touched me in the winter? The miracle of her fingers inside my mouth.
But she looked away. Picked at the bark of an old tree. For a long
time I have been frightened of the uncleanliness of my Father. I am
impure. I say, "I am impure.\" My body, I longing for one warm
night. One night of sleep. A way back inside where she forgets who I
am. The dark room where there are no lights. Nails, inherited from
ancient women driven mad against the moon and sons of fathers without
speech, cut into my palms. I live inside this house of silence where
no one breathes. *Not a word of this to anyone.* My voice joined
those of the ventriloquists in the attic. But once there had been
echoes. Noise from the streets of history. On the other side of
windows and mirrors. Persistent memories locked inside some lonely
cry to angels or deserted flesh against the walls in some back alley.
Left in that alley without a crumb trail. Nothing to follow. No way
back home. The policeman armed and ready looking into that alley at
me. Watching. Waiting for me to make my next move. Hands and boots
alert, waiting. Men in shirt sleeves leaning on windowsills with all
sorts of things to say about the Promised Land. Sauerkraut and
kielbassi. Rotten beer and cigars. My father gets me drunk again. Old
men in the shadows stare out at me. Look into my eyes little boy.
Come. I try to forget my name. Blisters. Cold sores. A mouth alive
with pain. I can barely unzip his pants. The scar on his thigh
terrifies me. He stands solid. Unmoving. Not even flinching. Smokes a
cigarette. Thinks of anyone but me. I keep thinking that he will fall
over on top of me. That he will die. Or that I will die. But he just
closes his eyes. Dreams. And neither of us seem able to die. My knees
hurt. Stone cold heart of gold. We go on living as if nothing is
happening. His pants at his ankles. Young boys turn their pockets
inside out and shrug their shoulders. Brilliant colors in the palms
of their hands all on fire. Offerings from nearly dead street gods. I
buy a stairway. Look left then right. Always look left first.
Grandmother logic from the old country. Knock on the side door to the
Piano Bar. These, my winter fingers, pick at the open diseases of my
infant skin. Cook up some damaged dreams. Mad bubbles boil on a
narrow, tight spoon. The needle takes on an eloquent life of its own.
I tap a nearly invisible line. A shot in the skies. Another lost
angel. My eyes burn white. Red scars. Infected memories. Rashes of my
spirit. Blood and blood. Skin of skin. Twisted hands. I cried beneath
my desire. I will not move from here until you have restored the
inside of my throat. My fingers I dip into the Holy Water. Receive
communion down into me with loving you. Small lips opened and
waiting. Interrupted by kisses. Each night more desperate than the
night before. "Just one more time,\" I hear him say. I cover my
mouth with my hands. Try not to breathe so much. Afraid I will awaken
God. If only for some water. If only some water beneath this red
rock. My skin dried by the sun. Rocks. Rubbing. Toil. He pulls my
hands away.

My only begotten mother, oddball woman, this mother lived the life of
a stranger to my blood. A woman unknown to me. A deaf woman off in
the distance. Always forever standing in the doorway but never once
entering my room. Frozen eyes. Nothing better to do. Watching.
Silenced lips cursed my birth. Dry mouth. Moving her feet against the
carpet. Static electricity with no place to go. Her soul lost in the
colors of some forgotten desert. Misshapen words. Crippled mouth
knowing only the lies of alcohol burning her bed. Told me
once-upon-a-time I would never be a girl, a real girl, the kind men
die for.

 


I creep down the hall. A hallway so dark that each time I walk down
it, I suffer the joy of amnesia. Forget my name. Connect nothing to
nothing. My sister, not me, trying to say I. This is my body to
follow the will of the Father. Once my father made me sleep in mud.
Rain. God makes it rain and the earth turns into mud and me unlocking
the door I enter the house. My body leaving marks on the kitchen
floor. God's soil. Wet. Footprints. Toes in the carpet. In my sleep,
I open the door of my parents' room. I always wanted to be a good
girl. Steal my father with a whisper. Take him away from my mother's
body into the shadows with promises of kisses. I drag him through the
dark corridors and up onto my bed. Pull off his clothes. And he
begins the punishing of me for having eyes too much like my
mother's. My hands on his back. Fingers digging into his skin. To
die with his red blood under my fingernails. To swallow him. His cum
inside me. So my body will become a witness. I throw my head back.
Tossed scraggly blonde hair. Dust. Blind ancestors. Holding tight his
strong body. Desire in my hands. Gave me his love and my hatred. I
rub my lips. I rub these lips. My lips. I rub my lips. Wild and free.
Fear. Keep silent as before and before that. There are no stories of
my silence. I catch my breath. Hold still. Wait. Skin. My eyes burn.
Salt words, grandma called them. The desires of the body are tears. I
shed these tears onto the hard floor wanting you. In some other life
she told me there were rumors of maps. Told me that concrete was not
impossible. My eyes drifting. Out of me. Follow the white lines.
Across the mirror I breathe in the mad suffering mysteries of angels.
Drag the angry burn into my blood. Teresa and I call it bone surge.
Away from me. I look away from all that is happening to me. Searching
for roads, paths that lead into the woods. Dull morphine desires.
Wanting. Want. Something. I stare into my open hands, her blood, and
try to remember desire. She had bleed onto my fingers. Flushed
forehead in dead heat. Spit from my mouth, from someone, on her skin.
Mixed with the red of her cut. I put my lips to the center of the
palm of her hand and kiss her blood. My body feels dry. Or I feel my
body is dry. Broken wrists. The back of my head against the wall. The
knees I spread. I give into you. Naked hand on the thigh. The other
holds the whip. You will listen to my voice today.

I remember my father could not talk in my bed. Night after night, my
deaf and dumb father cracking open my forehead. Burning into my
bones. His elbows in my flesh. Fists everywhere. Purple morning skin.
My wrists, twisted behind my back, small in the traps of my father's
hands. Burning Indian. Blemishes of a father's hurried love.
Promises made, spoken in spit. Every inch of him on top of my skin
and bones. Him. My father weighed 183 pounds. This, my body will
never forget. Sometimes he weighed more. Sometimes less. His knees
slightly above my knees. His chin down on the top of my forehead. For
years I practiced breathing into his neck. His sweat on me. One day
my father died. But that, his death, comes years later. Or maybe it
was yesterday. I make marks on the wall. Counting something. Days.
Nights. Both. Or desires.

# Jono Schneider: From *The Parable*



## Working Notes

###  WRITING THE TELLING'S WANTING

*Reading this excerpt from **The Parable**, what comes to mind is the
uncertainty of the "I\" that is speaking, that wants to speak the
speech of narrative, the speech enacted by writing. Narrative is a
story, but to focus solely on the object is to diminish the subject
that tells even as the subject is writing the telling. And this
telling is a wanting to tell that is also the telling's failure. The
telling fails to achieve the aim of the wanting and diminishes the
story being told, but not the wanting. All the while the voice of the
invisible speaker grows louder, deafening the reader with the sound
of words babbling over into writing. French literary theory calls
this babble* desire*; in **The Parable**, this desire is part of the
opening, is what opens up the story's opening to the reader, the
hole in the fabric of the story allowing writing to shine blankly
onto the narrative of character. "Of that I can be sure\"---with
this phrase the main character is the only plot. The speech moves
somewhere, introduces two additional characters than that of the
narrator, two colleagues, but they are the reason the narrator has a
story for the reader by way of the tone of his words, which gather up
a serene severity like the light in a Bergman film. The narrator
speaks as long as the speech s/he makes convinces the reader that
silence is the only possibility. The additional characters only serve
to distance the narrator from the rest of the world framed within the
speech being made, the world that this speech unfurls and thus uses
to gain the reader's confidence. It is this confidence that the
story elicits, but only at the reader's behest: \"the meaning of
this is unclear," as in \"still caught in an approach---and this
approach is a parable which I am writing." I would second the idea
of narrative as something that approaches a subject, that approaches
language even, but does not touch it, and this subject's being
untouched is what **The Parable** radiates outwards towards the
reader. As in Polanski's **The Tenant**, the narrator goes crazy
because he's alone in a room---the total devastation of narrative,
what makes writing jump into the still air.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------



**He had judged me**---of that I can be sure. His back faced me, and his
head was bent slightly forward; I could not hear what he was saying.
He did not stand up when I entered, though the meaning of this is
unclear, since it was she who had invited me to join them. Perhaps he
felt that I had interrupted them; they were, after all, talking in
her office, not his, meaning he had approached her because he must
have needed her confidence. I had broken that trust with my
appearance at the door; I shouldn't have come in at all had the door
not been open and had the sound of their voices not reached me in the
hall. I had other duties to attend to---this is true---but I was
unable to begin, and when I heard their voices, I sought them out to
forget these duties. A simple conversation with one's colleagues
often helps one to pass over the entire world in silence, and I
longed for the communion with others my work so rarely provides.

I was dressed horribly, and, by the way in which he looked at me, I
knew that he was glad that I was wearing the clothes I did: this set
me apart from them. He lowered his eyes when I sat down and kept them
on the ground for quite a long time---I had looked away, and I am not
sure when he finally raised his eyes to meet, to almost meet, mine.
My clothes bothered him, that was to be expected. I had tried other
clothes on, earlier, but I felt false in them, as if I were lowering
my voice to emphasize my authority, thus calling attention to my mere
lack of it. No, these were the clothes I must wear, and these were
the clothes I would be judged in; if these clothes added to the
severity of his judgment---well, I would readily accept that. I spoke
too much---this is also true---but how else could I have spoken? If I
said too little, then he would rush in and fill up the space between
the three of us with his silent judgment, and when I spoke, his look
silenced me as well, impressing upon me the fact that I could never
say enough for him. His silence, which he expressed calmly with his
mouth, where he hung a slack smile, further silenced me, so that I
spoke more quickly, more urgently than I felt or would have liked to
feel. Yet I did not feel anxious; I accepted his dislike of me
because it was the easiest thing in the world for me to return. I did
not hate him---let me be absolutely clear on this fact alone---but I
could have hated him, I found it easier to hate him than even my own
clothes, which I admit were horrible: frayed at the ends, ill fitted,
and ballooning out from my body. Surely no one could take me
seriously in them.

He seemed concerned with me. He was not speaking to me---he would no
longer look in my direction now that my speech---my stuttering and
stunted soliloquy---had ended, although now it is easy for me to
think of what I should have said, what kind of person I wanted him to
think I was, and what kind of person I was when I was alone. I wanted
him to know how much I cared---not about him, to care for him would
have been going too far---but how much I cared about life itself, by
which I meant the people for whom I worked and to whom I spoke and
would always be speaking, the people who were the reason for this
meeting---but I had entered the room to listen to him speak about his
own experiences in dealing with them. Even though he was now
speaking---and he was looking directly at her, he had moved closer to
her, their knees were almost touching while I had somehow pushed my
chair further into the corner---even though he was now speaking only
to her, and I couldn't hear what he was saying, she was looking at
me, she was smiling, she had liked what I said. Yes, she liked me
very much. She thought I was intelligent, an intellectual. Yes, an
intellectual. But I could not make him turn around, I could not make
him face me. I wanted him to tell me if he had eaten.

"But I\'m eating now; we\'re both eating now, don\'t you see?\"

I saw no food on the table---but the table had just now appeared, or
it had just been cleared---and their mouths were moving words, they
pushed words through the air---perhaps these words were being tested.
I could hear these words now---perhaps the words were being
tested---they were faint against the table and the door, they were
talking only of work, of speaking, and how to speak soundly without
raising one's voice. She was not eating---she was looking at my
pants; I had at least taken care of them: I had ironed and pressed
them, I had scrubbed until all the stains had disappeared. But I was
sweating now, and he had all the advantage for it. I was smiling, I
mimicked his smile and flashed it back at him, she smiled, we were
all smiling---but our faces no longer expressed happiness. I felt
slightly sick, but I was still hungry, and the fact that I had not
lost my appetite caused me to cry out---now I was feeling slightly
giddy.

"I\'m now on my way to eat---\" I stepped towards the door.

"But won\'t you join us?\" She was holding out her plate of food to
me.

I took it; he handed me a fork. I would eat, which would give me the
opportunity to listen; they were letting me in to listen, but only if
I kept my mouth still, which meant I had to fill it with food, and
that I would have to stop thinking. I was an intellectual, and I may
have had many thoughts which I needed to tell them, but for now I
would have to eat and be grateful for my work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Gratitude was a state of being, a condition, towards which he
aspired, I could see it shining on his face and reflecting back at
mine as he strained to choose his words. His voice was deeper than
mine, but he had no advantage over me because of it, as she kept
looking to me after he finished each point to see if I approved of
his ideas. Although I thought that his intelligence was limited---and
I still think this, although my certainty is surely slipping---I
sought to credit him; his dislike for me registered itself in the air
among us, and I struggled to keep my breathing even and measured by
grasping irregularly at the air with my mouth. He spoke, and he would
always speak, first.

"But you should eat more slowly! At the very least you should know
that!"

She had opened the windows. The air was slow in coming, but when it
finally reached me, I already felt that it had calmed me and that the
difficulty had passed. I had dropped my fork, and I saw my own face
reflecting back at me from the floor, mirrored by the prongs of the
fork that now lay at my feet. He was inspecting my shirt; I had left
my shirt untucked because I could work more easily without it stuffed
into my pants. He handed me a napkin and resumed, his talk easily
inflated by this gesture he had made only for me.

"One should always be present. Yes, at the very least, one should
face one's responsibilities!\"

His hand had taken my plate away from me. How very odd this seems to
me now, I must say, for just as I had earlier seen no food, I had now
grown quite hungry, and I had no other desire than to lift the fork
from the plate to my mouth and back again. It seems to me that it was
only when I had begun to eat with emotion that he became interested
in clearing my plate, as if his manners masked a deeper, more
mysterious motive. He had turned his back to me again, now he was so
close to her as to be whispering. Her face had contorted at his
unexpectedly close approach, and I thought I noticed him trying to
comfort her. My discomfort was not caused by his hatred---this I can
clearly understand, had I been him I would have acted with less tact,
that is certain---but from his attempts at co-opting her into his
hatred, which only furthered my desire to destroy her. But I did not
intend on lifting my hand against her; what I needed was to get her
away from here, I needed him on his own to make him understand what I
was saying, why I sat the way I did, why I liked the food I did, etc.
But as long as she was there, trying to speak to him on my behalf, I
would have no opportunity to teach him about me; as long as she was
there, he would continue, he did continue, to look at her, to desire
her approval, which, as all three of us were aware of, she was
lavishing upon me because she was an intellectual as well. He might
have also been an intellectual had he not spoken in such earnest, had
he not let his need to have someone else support him rise so clearly
to the surface of his speech. Yes, my speech had failed badly,
miserably, but I spoke with the detachment of a man who has yet to
have said, who is still to think, what it is most important for him
to say. His speech, you will say, was more honest, more in earnest
than mine; here I will not hesitate to agree with you. But I had not
been trained to be honest---I had been trained, I should say, in
policy, and having learned policy to the point where I could
endlessly elaborate on it in terms of form, content, and commentary,
I was fearful whenever conversation required that I venture beyond my
training.

I wanted to continue eating, but it seems to me now that it was
clearly impossible to do so; as I said, his hand had taken my plate
away from me. But more than that, it was the way in which he was now
speaking that made eating impossible, for he had placed my plate---
he must have filled it again after taking it from me, for I was so
hungry that I had cleaned the food off of it almost immediately--- he
had placed my plate on a small filing cabinet just to his right,
where he had also laid his glasses aside, and now he picked them up,
although he didn't put them on his face---he kept kneading them with
his fingers while he launched into a new speech about the endless
dedication to one's work and how this dedication must be final, the
endpoint of one's goals in life. He spoke about the future and how
it could be filled with nothing but work itself and those whom the
work served. He was furious now, he was no longer whispering, he was
standing between the two of us, and the look on her face told me it
was my turn to act by replying to his emotions with the logic,
reason, and wit of an intellectual, but I was too preoccupied with
the food that he was keeping from me to think with the clarity that
his vicious speech demanded me to return. But it seems to me now that
this is an oversight on my part, that I could have easily stepped in
front of him and grabbed the food while he continued, and that he
would have thought nothing of it, because he was too involved in
other actions: he was mutilating his glasses, twisting the frames
into shapes that resembled the faces he was making at the time he was
speaking to emphasize this speech and the time that it took away from
us. I very well could have done this, which tells me that if this
action was possible, then I must have done it, for I have learned
that one does what it is possible for one to do in any situation and
no more. So this is what I must have done, since my clothes had
already disarmed me -- although I was happy, perhaps I even felt
ecstasy, in them. I reached across him and took back my plate, but
the food was cold, and I ate it hastily and without pleasure, meaning
that this moment, as did the others, belonged to him, and he had
invented it purely to vex me and cause my immediate dismissal.

But I did not withdraw---if you read the transcripts, you will
clearly see this, there are three voices on that tape. It was she who
kept silent for most of the remaining time, smiling when I pointed
out options that he hadn't yet considered, and pulling her mouth
taut when he derailed the conversation with anger. The tapes tell the
truth, that is why I carry my recorder in my pocket. How was I to
know that he was taping all of this as well, and that he would hand
his transcriptions into the committee before I had even been given a
chance to listen to his tape? I was cautious, yes, and I had seized
the opportunities that were available to me, but I had not foreseen
him. In fact, I knew next to nothing about him before entering the
room where they had been quietly talking, I had gone in there to see
her, but having heard two voices, I was, as I said, quite
anxious---too anxious, it is now clear--- to be a part of a
conversation which I was confident I could add---and learn from, and
yet I wanted to defend myself before any rumors had begun about me.
You will say that I am nervous, that it is my nerves--- and I am
quite the nervous type, I will not deny this---but I have found that
it is better to circumvent what is said about one than to wait for
the speech to arise and become writing, or policy, as they say. They
say this, I know, because now I can hear them talking in the room
adjacent to the empty cell in which I am writing this, and I have
heard them say this word---"policy\"---no less than ten times in the
half-hour that I have been able to overhear them. Surely, you will
say, that ten times in half an hour is not that many times for a word
to be said--- once every three minutes---and this is true, but in
relation to all the other words that I can make out, this number is
quite large, since they have repeated not even one of those other
words, other than my name, which I hear said at the beginning of each
sentence, and they argue knowing I am listening to them speak, and
they do not care.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


He had handed me a toothpick---I am certain of this, else how would
they have found it in my pocket later, after everything had come to
an end? I remember thinking that I was surprised at how sharp it
was--- it seemed to me that someone had intentionally sharpened the
toothpick to keep me from putting it in my mouth---and perhaps this
was what he had done---instilling fear in me: fears of my tongue
being cut, my speech being disabled, and my eloquence being reduced
to a whimper. So I put the toothpick in my coat pocket, and I put my
hand in my pocket from time to time to make sure I had not lost or
forgotten it---if I knew anything, it was that I could keep this tool
in perfect condition, I would prove to him that it was possible that
an intellectual could take care of the body. She did not receive a
toothpick, and while he handed one to me, I saw the look on her face
indicate a change in the room. Now the window was wide open, the wind
brought fresh air into the room, but she had changed, too---his
gesture of offering me something that was his and his alone,
something that preceded this meeting, had excluded her, and from that
moment on she was lost to us. I was very happy---I will even go so
far here as to say I was ecstatic, and the traces of this feeling are
still with me now, for it was no longer my responsibility to get rid
of her, a job I had feared from the outset because I had thought that
whatever I would do to her would not escape him, and I didn't want
him to know, or to guess at, anything else about me besides what I
had already told him. He may not have initially intended this effect,
but he surely could not have failed to notice that she was gone, she
was leaving, she would be leaving, and even if she didn't move from
her chair, we both knew that she would neither speak nor look at us
for the remainder of the afternoon. She only looked down at her
hands, alternating this with a look at the floor, successfully
avoiding us, no doubt, but only because she had to avoid us. So now
we were entirely free to say whatever we needed to.

And yet I soon missed her, for the talk was a tougher climb than
ever, as he asked me to repeat myself several times, and more than
that, to define certain words for him. Really, I was defining
everything for him, he couldn't understand me, and because I was an
intellectual and he was not, we had no language in common. And I was
straining, I was at my very limits---limits which it has, you must
know, taken me years to build and even longer to expand---and it
seemed as if my words would no longer hold me. I thought back to the
quality of the speech between the two of them before I had
entered---there was something remarkably easy about it, as if there
were no need to test the value of language itself because their talk
was not rooted in ideas. No, they were merely two people talking, and
they still talk this way as far as I know; it was my speech, the
speech of an intellectual, that was the voice of another, the voice
that suggested others. But here you will point out that I have said
she was also an intellectual--- this is true---but she was only an
intellectual when she needed to be, when the situation demanded this
of her. This demand arose out of my presence, since any other speech
handcuffed me and angered me to the point of irrefutable testimony in
the form of logical arguments or "auditory editorializing\" as I
like to call it. I have only this term to introduce to the world, and
when I told him of this discovery (my new way of working), he scowled
in disapproval and then launched into a prolonged battle cry that
exemplified my technique better than any instruction manual I could
have written for my employers. By hating me even further, he had
miraculously understood me more fully than those for whom I had
created, and still dictate, policy; I had done this to make him
obsolete, and now I was in need of him even more, while I became an
intellectual at an even higher level, and I spoke to him from an even
more acute distance, than before.

I am now well aware that there are still many questions that I am in
need of answering, and yet I press on because I must ask still more
questions in order to be fully prepared for the final inquiry which
may take place at any time, including the past. I can feel your
impatience on the other side of the page, but I urge you to calm
yourself, for the obscurity of my documentation hardly approaches my
own impatience and the harshness which rises up in me from
suppressing this patience each time I try to move ahead too quickly.
Perhaps you can think of me in the following terms: if you are asking
me a question, I am asking the same question to a dead man who is
still dying, a man who has never been ill, as his illness has not yet
reached him, it is still caught in an approach---and this approach is
a parable which I am writing.

## "Both And\": A Statement for Narrativity

*Bob Glück gave me back the sentence, a line of elastic stretching
across the page. I had stood at the edge of the lyric and fallen in.
I had swallowed the lyric and choked on it. I had been lured into the
lyric's boudoir and slammed my elbows against the walls just trying
to turn around. I was out of metaphors.
Though I still engage the lyric, writing in prose allows me a kind of
freedom to explore the nether regions of sexuality and gender, to
stroke the unnamable places, to crack my head up against the jagged
edge. My world is troubled by "either ors\": straight or gay, male
or female, black or white, poetry or prose. I'm lodged in the cracks
between them, dynamiting my way out.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Adjustable Perches

**My boy-girl princess** all groovy this evening, sharp with elbows and
shoulder blades. Desire across boundaries too sharp to cross. 24
hours of comfortable heat.

Our skins slide across. Sweet-cheeked girl peck. A baby's unformed
milky bones.

A pact to reflect daily resonances. "I miss you,\" means \"Do you
miss me?"

A cupboard and a roof. Rough wooden shelves soaked with white paint.
The smell of oil flares our nostrils.

Your hand encloses mine, ratifying physical laws when you dismantle
me step by step. My weeping fresh and startling, you contract your
awe-struck mouth. Anticipatory like the smell of rain.

The temptation to bring you inside, where the light slants across my
desk, warming my pale skin. Afternoon lassitude of linguistic junk.
White boats across the lake.

Returning is a grand gesture emphasizing departure. When I finally
lose sight of you, the earth still suspends my body in its animation.

My freshly parted hair still damp from the morning, when you turned,
wanting me, all sleepy-eyed softness.

The road ahead craggy and distant multiples our longing, my breath in
hiccups, false stops until we find the wave that continues.

We proceed as if finding bread crumbs on a trail.

The containment I experience through your matter-of-fact nod proceeds
outbursts designed to unloose your fibrillar emotions. Dichotomies
which bore me.

What's the gift, the partial barter, which promotes our stasis---you
waiting for disintegration, and I for a stable distance. I can accept
your intimacy in your absence.

Words an elevated foreground, everywhere falling fictive, furious
scatter shot. I slip the pellet underneath my tongue, hidden in an
enclosure of human temperature.

In our shared understanding, there are few formulas to interpret this
new-found wound, wound round characters you describe as real. Goals
program the future requiring the abstraction of my body in front of
you.

Time telescopes individual events, cheating clarity. Metaphysical
photos, faces sunk in relief. For now, kiss me in the way I remember
and let us look into the light of the morning.

 

## 7. Bait and Switch

Or simply that it's me and not other other. Even if it is.

Dodie turns up the "D\" in degenerate. The irony that fucking
boys--- not girls---made me into a first-class pervert. I laid claim
to his dick like it was my own---a rightful part of myself gone
missing. This one said he couldn't fuck me without getting
emotionally involved. He could clasp both of my wrists in one muscled
hand. Prone, I lay on top of him, my body floating on an island.

In a semi-trance state he discovers his desire to kill his mother. He
says, "Many women had paid for what you have done.\" In fairy tales,
Mom is always to blame. My left thumbnail refuses to adhere. If I
were to fall in love, I'd have to bring the white trash with me. I
hide my guilty desire to spend long periods of time alone.

Of course, when I wanted something, I always knew it. The very
intensity of my desire keeping it out of reach (or so I believed).
She kept herself from fear or disappointment by turning off her own
desire completely---while I was filled voraciously with need. Greed,
while unbecoming in a woman, is prized in men.

Another claimed that my very presence increased his need to be more
"manly.\" He opened doors for me, refused cute pet names, and fucked
me righteously.

My body demanded something to show for itself. Writing is thievery,
as in stealing time.

Anxiety is a sticky substance infused with fear. Dollar for dollar.
Or, for instance, poverty. My own collusion in bourgeois appearances
bleeding me dry. The need to be seen or recognized outweighing other
emotional vaunts. Every song he laid in my ear keeping my mouth and
nose above water.

But respiration takes place in lack of desire. Once your head hits
the floor, the body resumes intake and expiration. The old in and
out.

Anger, not sex, is what makes a girl really bad.

 

## 8. Epilogue

Her indestructible thighs. A vertical line going south. From belly
button to pubic bone. Brand-new scar.

She wears high heels like in dreams. Stunned. Apostate.

I could have said he only fell for tragic women, but I was falling
for tragic men. You know, their darkness, their pain. "You light up
my life, you give me hope, to carry on," Debby Boone was singing to
me.

I turned to my girlfriends. They had strong shoulders and clear
thoughts. Wedged in the back seat, her arm brushed against my breast
and rested there.

A man who saw the world through film, but experienced a lack of
vision. A man I encounter through dailiness, through habit. A man
with the hands of my father.

Distance spreads. Across your lips.

Your hips move me. Hand in glove.

Pink. Drawn into the skin. All summer. Or all winter. Scripted. Cut.

Rushing headlong in with the body and checking positions later.
Velocity.

Or when his dreadlocks were a lot less polite looking. That it was
all fair game. Down to the very last vowel. Avowal.

Two loulous wrapped rapt in bed sheets.

Baby's got Mingus Fingers. All around and through me. To thrill me.

Baby done gone and you know it know. Something to show for. Here and
before now. Baby done proved it.

All in a groove now. Here and before now. Oh, baby, you knew it.

Girl to girlness reveals a surety surfeit. Our beliefs clamoring for
real estate.

Churl. Countryman. Highlander.

Every possible apology or minimization. Privation. Dilation.

She dressed with her back to him, then left the motel room and walked
down to the water. Bare-legged and bare-armed in her cotton jersey
dress.

She had a sense that the dream had ended and she had slept on.
Further and farther. Up and away.

The first time he entered me he said, "I think we\'ve got a match
baby," and I sealed this sentence in my heart and swallowed the key.

Unmatched by, "I think I\'m falling in love with you, you
son-of-a-bitch," and later this made me smile, laughing at myself.

What she was staving off or holding out against. A grammar of
indeterminancy. A cold water walk-up.

She had watched them in supermarkets and knew the signs. All the
indices of the idle lonely.

Happiness came like an unmarked box without directions. She kept
trying to catch herself in it, afraid it would pass without her
noticing.

Inscribing my language upon him. Brush strokes along the abdomen.
Purple-black nipples. Smooth, round ass.

Endless expanse of what if. Figure brought into fruition. A thorough
dressing down. Round or through me. A voice on the wire.

Or if I wrote "wife.\" Rife. Theocracy. Meritorious.

Mercy. For the woman's clandestine, zippered heart. Miles I have
come before you. Previously unknown.

Everyone got what he came for. A schedule to rival the master's.
Departures and arrivals. A vagabond. A conductor.

Miles I crossed the desert for water. Previously alone.

At the end of it all a ringing phone and she does not rise to answer
it. It twitters at the edges of her sleep.

Verboten. Far gone.

She wonders if this will be one of those evenings when something
unimaginable would occur. And the language used to describe it later.

What he was willing to do for her, and the sexiness of that.
Eroticization of her pleasure.

He covers the receiver with his palm and turns away.

I arranged everything and at the appointed hour the three of them
arrived. Before any words were spoken, I recognized him by the sound
of his breathing.

She drove her new BMW up to the GoodWill and was confused by the
people staring. I smiled and tried to act "natural.\"

I was the second man to fuck him. The first he met while he was still
in school. "Don\'t you go to UCLA?\" It was a kind of code.

At the end of the day, his body a destination. Miles on a train I
have traveled postponing pleasure. Our voices hang in the air, I
touch myself.

Miles I have traveled to hear his breathing. Loudly overtaking him in
sleep, a comforting wheeze which lulls me.

Prone. His locks falling forward across his face. My dick gets hard
just looking at his ass.

There can be no question or assumption. The girlfriend in L.A. The
fits of rage or depression. The unshakable self-centeredness. All
waiting to be read like a dime store novel.

My narrative spins out like a car in the rain.

Our lives a careening that could have taken us anywhere. The sheer
random force of it underscoring her belief.

She weaves a web of talk. Contentment, stranger to this snare.

Used to desire, but uncomfortable with need. She covers her head with
the blanket to keep from shivering.

The whiteness of my arms practically glowing in the dimmed light, up
against his dark, supple skin.

When I fucked him, a high, clear-pitched sigh rang out from his mouth
each time he exhaled. "Go easy, baby,\" he said. And I withdrew my
dick, softly, gently exploring his ass until I gave it to him once
again harder. He tossed his head back sharply, his locks raining off
his face.

Fists of wanting. Emboldened by grief. A world apart. Of frost.

No sooner than. No later. Had she walked to the door. Bereft.

Solidity in solitude. A place in the life cycle. Searching on hands
and knees. He fucked me so hard that I bled. Four fingers in my cunt,
nearly a fist.

"What I feel for you now is all I will ever feel for you.\" And
ever. A straightjacket.

Given to histrionics. Or expected.

Protected more than risked.

Stutter. Choke. Recede.

My arms a fortress.

Each flag in a field.

The harder my dick, the wetter his pussy. The deeper I fucked him,
the more open he became.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**I'm interested in the utilization** of both poetic and narrative
tensions: the flagrant surfaces of lyric, the sweet dream of storied
events, the terror of ellipsis, the audacity of dislocation, the
irreversible solidity of the past tense, the incarnate lure of
pronouns, the refractability of pronouns, the simultaneity of times,
the weights and balances of sentences. I'm interested in lyric\'s
authenticity of demonstration and narrative's drama of integration;
lyric, whose operation is display, and narrative, whose method is
seduction. I describe a set of binary terms across which I see
writing passing an exchange of values, and it becomes a multiple
texture/text---writing in just those created tensions between surface
vocalic tangibility and referential transparency; between theme and
emptiness, measure and interruption, the eternal present and past of
memory/future of dream; all present, all heightened, operational.
Such conflated writing would be worthy of Barthes's definition of
the text: "not a coexistence of meanings but a passage, an
overcrossing; thus it answers not to an interpretation, even a
liberal one, but to an explosion, a dissemination." [^2_shurin_1]
One seeks to be out of order, to shiver out of
subjectivity, to shake off the mask of the material and to shimmy in
its arms, to finally retreat from logic and advance by radial
maneuvers, gathering meaning. "To break the sentence,\" says Rachel
Blau DuPlessis---and here the sentence carries its overtone of
imprisonment without parole---

rejects not grammar especially, but rhythm, pace, flow, expression:
the structuring of the female voice by the male voice, female tone
and manner by male expectations, female writing by male emphasis,
female writing by existing conventions of gender---in short, any
way in which dominant structures shape muted ones. [^2_shurin_2]

One looks for alternate methods to proceed, to use and subvert the
codes at hand: stanza, line break, character, plot, point of view.

In "The New Sentence,\" Ron Silliman suggests ways in which the
prose poem has used combined and measured sentences to interiorize
poetic structure, foregrounding language operations and surface
values in a writing mode---prose---whose usual form is the syllogism,
building structures of projection and depth. "The torquing which is
normally triggered by linebreaks," he points out, \"the function of
which is to enhance ambiguity and polysemy, has now moved into the
grammar of the sentence." [^2_shurin_3] The paragraph as a
unit of quantity and the sentence as a unit of measure, altered
sentence structure, controlled and limited integration: these devices
begin to conflate the values of poetry with those of prose. Other
writers have pursued not just prose but narrative prose, and
foregrounded narrative codes to awaken a reader's attention to
process as well as result. In his novel, Jack the Modernist, Robert
Glück uses metaphorical and metonymic litanies side by side, showing
off the writing as writing as he demonstrates that the devices are
not mutually exclusive.

I grab his cock, unpromising, and he says in mock bewilderment,
"What\'s that?\" As it hardens I answer for him, \"It\'s my
appendicitis, my inchworm, my slug, my yardstick, my viola da
gamba, my World Trade Center, my banana, my statutory rape, my late
string quartet, my garden god, my minaret, my magnum opus, my
datebook, my hornet, my Giacometti, my West Side Story, my lance,
my cannon, my nose-job, my hot dog, my little sparrow, my worm on
the sidewalk after a storm, my candle, my Bic, my unicorn, my
drawbridge, my white whale... [^2_shurin_4]

and on for another sixty substitutions, "my cyclops ... my Venus of
Willendorf ... my Dark Tower." Four pages later the elaborative
metonymic process of prose takes over from the comparative
metaphorical process of poetry.

My troubles were too numerous to consider all at once, their sheer
quantity defeated me. My mom would say, "Write a list, get a
handle on your problems, deprive them of their active ingredient,
time." So I found a clean page in my yellow legal tablet ...
Nuclear catastrophe, destitution, famine, additives, melanomas,
losing face, U.S. involvement in El Salvador and Nicaragua, Puerto
Rico, South Korea, Chile, Lebanon and Argentina, war in the Middle
East, genocide of Guatemalan Indians and extermination of the
native peoples of Brazil, Philippines, Australia, answering the
telephone ... toxic waste, snipers, wrinkles, cult murderers, my
car ... [^2_shurin_5]

Though these are both descriptive processes, they are not
transparent; the reader is aware of being in a list, enjoys the
ingenuity of elaboration and substitution, is held to the surface of
the writing at the same time she is integrating the lists into the
larger structures of the story. Speaking of description, Alexander
Gelley writes,

This kind of stillness in the narrative may be likened to islands
of repose for the reader, moments of collection. The hold that the
level of plot, speech, and action exercises on him is loosened. His
attention may wander, but it may also adjust to a changed mode of
apprehension. I am suggesting that the more circumstantial the
description and the more separate from the narrative in which it is
embedded, the greater will be the reader's part, and the more he
will be forced to assume a stance for which the narrative proper
offers little support.... When the familiar codes of narrative are
blocked or diverted, reading/writing becomes problematic, and the
subject of/in the narrative shifts from the characters or the
author to the reader.... [^2_shurin_6]

This problematization forces the reader to ask questions, to become
active in the role of reader, and Glück reinforces this tendency by
confronting the reader directly in his stories, "You\'ll understand
my fear," he says, \"because television has trained us to understand
the fear of a running man;" and, \"I can only give this story, which
is the same as sitting with my back to you;" and, \"Tell me, given
the options, where would your anger have taken you---where has it
taken you?" By confronting the reader, Glück not only breaks the
window of his narrative but creates and engages an audience, creates
a social registration for his writing by direct address, by luring
the "real\" time of the reader into the \"dream\" time of his story.
The foregrounding of devices and codes does not neutralize them, they
are too full of historical determination, but it can ritualize them,
or expose their ritualization; reveal them not as necessities but
constructions---open to change.

Writing might use narrativity without succumbing to its hegemonic
orders of linear development, unity of time/tense---and apart from
the modernist reconstructing modes of memory and dream. A prose whose
paragraphic groupings themselves might be based on measure, whose
higher integrations might be thematic or associational rather than
developmental. "How tenacious is our happiness!\" says Kevin Killian
in Shy. "Unlike narrative, it invents and eludes itself from moment
to moment; it lacks conventions; its shape has no outline, its formal
properties those of the cloud---numinous, portentous, hungry...."
[^2_shurin_7] And then goes on to produce a narrative with
properties of the cloud, numinous and hungry, where characters search
for themselves alongside the writer as a character himself, where
persons encounter each other but never stoop so low as to engage in a
plot.

The ceiling was gray and smooth as the beach that Gunther Fielder
lived by. Flat, and peaceful, the way that "now\" is without a
past or future to rock it up any. He could focus on the gray and
try to hypnotize himself, closer towards death. "Do it,\" he
demanded.

"My name is Harry Van,\" he said. It sounded so false.
He said it over and over, didn't ring true somehow. Like somebody
else who you couldn't remember. Well try again, something new.

"I\'m David Bowie,\" he said, experimenting. \"I have
come to earth a space invader, hot tramp, I love you so." Oh that
was so suffragette, trying to "be\" a star.

He'd start again. \"Hi, my name is Mark the dead boy,\"
he said with great difficulty.

Yes.

"Are you Kevin Killian,\" he replied. \"Can I help
you?" Just like the Hot Line!

These voices came out of his mouth from nowhere, between
heaven and earth, this conversation developing like a photograph
pulled from its tray full of crystal chemicals. Emergent.
[^2_shurin_8]

These voices attack the proposition that characters or author must be
unified presences, and suggest that self itself may not be locatable
along such a monochromatic line.

He is telling you now a story about narrativity, he is telling her
story. She finds the story as she looks at each other: so many faces.
She is crossing gender from the start, she wants you to know she is
Elizabeth Taylor---and has the Halloween photos to prove it. He is a
boy playing Puck in a high school production of A Midsummer Night's
Dream wearing ballet slippers forever. "I have died and am in a
novel and was a lyric poet, certainly, who attracted crowds to
mountaintops." [^2_shurin_9] I come after Robert Duncan but
before Norma Cole. My name is
"Broiling-Days-In-A-Little-Patch-Of-Shade.\" \"For better or
worse," says Flaubert,

> it is a delicious thing to write, to be no longer yourself but to
> move in an entire universe of your own creating. Today, for
> instance, as man and woman, both lover and mistress, I rode in a
> forest on an autumn afternoon under the yellow leaves, and I was
> also the horses, the leaves, the wind, the words my people uttered,
> even the red sun that made them almost close their love-drowned
> eyes. [^2_shurin_10]

"Voice,\" \"Person,\" \"Point of View\"---always singular---propose
a unified filter through which events may be organized, and as
filters screen properties, screen out toxins and tannins and pieces
too big to fit neatly. But pluralities are possible. "I see only
from one point of view," says Lacan, \"but in my existence I am
looked at from all sides."[^2_shurin_11] Pronouns are
known as shifters because they are by nature unstable linguistic
units, referring not to people but to moving circumstances of speech
and audition, visibility and perception. As such they are fictional
opportunities; unlike names they permit a character to be subject and
object, to ride the Wheel of Person, speak and be spoken of with
equal weight, inhabit simultaneity. Here is a poem from Alice
Notley's sequence, \"Congratulating Wedge\":

| No I wouldn't know why anyone would
| want to write like that. I should never
| have had to do it. We were used to this
| other thing we always know like when we're
| here. And you have this clear head and you're
| seeing things and there they are. You don't
| notice they're spelled. That\'s how you
| know you're alive. I never saw you
| looking like a dictionary definition and if I
| did I wouldn't tell nobody. People
| aren't like that. They say, Hey
| asshole motherfucker turn that radio
| off! But the sun's playing on it! But
| it ain't real, you dumb package!
| I recognize every package the way it
| comes. Now I'm mixed up. But I
| always wanted to be a package, person
| thinks. Do they? Or, I gotta de-
| fine this package, me. Or, God if only
| I was a package but I'm not.
[^2_shurin_12]

What are people like and what method correctly presents/represents
them; from what angles are they constructed and who construes the
angles into voice? In her mind as "I,\" out of her mind as \"she,\"
confronting or confronted by "you\"; conspiratorially social and
partial as "we\"; part of one another, occasionally indistinct,
certainly indiscreet, we are and we are not separate people. "My
premise, in general and in writing," says Leslie Scalapino, \"is
that I do not think there is a man, or woman, or society, social
construction; though it is there. It is not there." [^2_shurin_13]
I have been marginalized as a poet, homosexual,
counterculture protester, drug taker, transvestite and Jew; I am as
interested in boundaries for what lies outside them as in. I would
like to drop my "characters\" onto the sharpened point of a
gemstone, so that the radial fractures would illuminate a
comprehensive pluralistic image.

Syntax is the plot of the sentence, a systematic ordering of person
and event, of who does what to whom and when and to what end. Encoded
in its structure are a variety of fixed agreements that always end in
a point (.) Who will speak for beside-the-point? Nouns and verbs must
have parallel numbers, pronouns and verbs parallel persons; tenses
must agree to produce time that resembles progression. Business
conveniences that make of stories little prisons of discrete power
relations with seemingly invisible walls. I am not talking about
referentiality vs. non-referentiality; I'm talking about how
narrative referentiality might be better served. Gender is
foregrounded and elementalized, digressions are trivialized, passive
constructions frowned upon. As Sara Schulman points out, try to tell
a lesbian story without names: she came into a room, she looked at
her, she looked at her, she said---and aside from homophobia, what
terrors would such unlocations unleash? Normative pronoun usage
subjects self and other to power/dominance models of unity and
authority, of he over she and it beneath them. For pure syntax there
is Charley Shively's reduction of the phallocentric rule: \"the
subject fucks the object."[^2_shurin_14]

Here is Leslie Scalapino writing:

> The young person living there, having an intense tortured as if
> tearing in half pain in the middle, waking lying asleep, though
> this had only occurred this one time. The day and night being free
> of the one person, who hadn't had this tortured sharp pain as if
> to tear her in half except this one time, the man lying waking
> staying gently with her during it through the soft darkness and
> then ending in the warm balmy day with the people around who go
> down the street.[^2_shurin_15]

Passive participial constructions which don't inhabit time,
genderless and then confusing gender assignations, unlocated relative
pronouns, erratic time shifts without one simple present tense: an
amalgam of person and event that keeps elements suspended and active,
"an explosion, a dissemination\" of meaning. \"His mouth are
everywhere," I wrote erotically in \"Honor Roll,\" insisting that
the plural verb was truer to the polyvalence of desire.

And I have neither a coherent story to tell nor can I cop a coherent
attitude to give my voice a characteristic singularity. I was born in
sleep and raised in sleep and wake up to find myself sleepwalking.
The figures I know all have shadows; some figures are smaller than
their shadows. In the first photo I am a soft blasted thing, mouth
open tongue hanging, blotto. Six weeks premature, I was still "in
here" out there. The world was unformed, coalescent. His story is
the story of an intuited world, a story where digressions may be the
point, where ellipsis is an accurate representation of what there is.

This world in its order decomposes into air, simultaneously present
and absent. A writing, then, of enmeshed simultaneities, which gives
sufficient weight to its constituent presences so that they verge
upon each other. The material relations of the Unknown. "The stuff
of the psyche," says Herakleitos, \"is a smoke-like substance of
finest particles, that give rise to all other things.... it is
constantly in motion: only movement can know movement."
[^2_shurin_16] His story pulls the reader down from the
surface of language not to rest but to ride back and forth between
the manifest and imaginary worlds, among selves. "I wanted to write
a story," he begins, \"to talk about the outside world and escape my
projections, but the outside world could not escape from my
projections. I wanted to write not 'my\' story but \'theirs\'; I
wanted to write about evil." He looks at his fingers to escape your
accusations; a sunbeam deconstructs him into motes. He is happy
dissolved there, and wants to write from such dissolutions, melting
into the grain of his lover's nipples. He has no lover; he has
entered an argument about narrative and political ruination. "Tell
me your story," he asks, and you do.

Here in this dialogue writing relies less on information, as Walter
Benjamin shows, than on the moral power of interpretation, "to keep
a story free from explanation." It is left up to the reader to
"interpret things the way he understands them, and thus narrative
achieves an amplitude that information lacks."[^2_shurin_17]
Here a fabricated house open to the wind is both a shelter
and a sharpener of the wind's bite, a house of shadows and a moving
shadow that resembles a house. Narrativity, the action not the thing,
a happening semblance that is and is not a story, a gift given and
taken away so that one must finally stand fulfilled by transgression.
Narrativity, a process of integration not linear but aggregate,
circular, partial---and so, complete.

## On Narrative

### 3:28am

**The temporal element** of narrative humanizes, introducing history,
biography and, therefore, mortality; as time is presenced, so is
humanity and, so then, is the passing of time. What are the
implications for the conceptualization of human history if, through
temporality, pronouns become subjective and indeterminate, if
temporal elements in narrative are disjoined or occur simultaneously?
What are the implications if we are seduced by narrative, by the
promise of passing time (in an eroticized dance with death), and are
not led toward syllogism and deduction but discover, instead,
induction, investigation, participation?

Aaron Shurin, in "Narrativity,\" proposes that \"writing might use
narrative without succumbing to its hegemonic orders of linear
development, unity of time/tense-and apart from the modernist
reconstructing modes of memory and dream. A prose whose paragraphic
groupings themselves might be based on measure, whose higher
integrations might be thematic or associational rather than
developmental."

When liberated from plodding development, can narrative, loaded with
its historical implications, move us away from the discrete series
and veer toward witness, philosophy, discovery?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2:48am

Turn your face toward the back seat. Walk up the stairs to an
apartment set in stone. Listen to the parking lot below. A man lies
on the outside of a fence, exhaling. This is the view of others'
rooftops, making them into little pieces of pie. Rows of fluorescent
tubes. On the islands of a nearly drained sea, turtles lie exposed
and cracked roots tremble in a particularly strong wind. The mail is
delivered with surprising accuracy down the storm drain. You're
alarmed by the presence of gunmen in your hotel room.

## 2:49am

A policeman on the street looks through layers of glass. A very dead
thing. Motion toward the approaching car. Now you would like to leave
by way of the great hall. Strange ways and the lack of knowledge of
local customs prevent you from negotiating stillness. Manage nothing.
Reptile.

## 4:58am

Lying on the night flattened. Maps of territory barely existent.
Pools cover the floor. A single drip from the middle of the air. You
think this might be the kingfisher. Two figures in the middle of the
room-translucent. Thin warmth of blue light in a very small town. As
padding footsteps structure the quiet, a man looks from the top of a
house. They lie in a casual circle sleeping on the ocean floor.



## 4:59am

He pats his suit pocket, fingers the traveler's checks in his shoes.
Trucks begin to unload themselves all around. Drop off to sleep. Many
floors up the windows are missing. Entry is enclosed. Water continues
to drip.

## 3:29am

Walk below the surface and pick at the matrix of possibilities.
Shifting focus, a spray of bubbles through water, padded air on the
ceiling. A bent neck, S shaped, springs forward when needed, weeding
out the sick and the old.

## 5:13am

Synapse. The kingfisher hovers. Get together. A crush of grace. The
beats between are short. A real taste. A hand's distance from the
floor. Wings over balconies, through glass. On the inside of the
skin, very sweet and it becomes petrified.

## 2:16am

A car brings someone to this very corner. The greatest are able to
brace themselves, to support a moving supply. This too is style, you
think. Behind you in the car is a man. Turn around quickly to find
the shell of a turtle. You tremble at the lack of knowledge, at the
blue light. You're alarmed now by the lack of presence.

## 4:22pm

Click of ribs. Drone, repeat. Footbridge. Highway. Landing zone
agenda. Corrective maneuvers. Unassailable.

## 6:12am

Dawn begins below the floor, sends razors, slits, leaves an overall
impression. You concentrate on the phenomenon. The television
presents you with a flat grey surface. Leave marks on the sandbar.
Retract yourself as the tide rises. Deactivated bleakness. Wiggle
your fingers as complexities weave into numb certainty. A fin is
cutting through, toward equilibrium. Paths intersect. A car door
opens. Apartments. Surprisingly nimble. Walk around inside. Retract.

## 2:59pm

Somnambulence. Funicular shoes. The growth rate is a recursive
soliloquy. Some tetrahedral antipathy. Total shadow. Halitosis gloss.

## 5:55am

Unscathed, a memoir progressively installed. Move across the field of
vision. Turn ash piles. Bristle with teeth. Bone worms make their
paths. Spillover highway fanned out. Contrite motive. Recount sobs.
Astonished circuits in a coma. Damp faces. The nerve protectants.

## 2:12am

Open the door onto the waves. Drop beneath tension to the street.
Find your way along in the dark, fingering shells. Cling to a ledge,
creating shelter, always watching what hovers, what makes you burrow
in wet soil. The ceiling is glass. Peering from above. Under the
gaze, crawl about your business. A great neck dips, picks morsels
from below. At any moment. In the back seat of the car, in the
security of a bed, on the street, beneath the surface, on a small
island, in the bones.




# Lawrence Upton: TRAN, from *EASY KILL*



 


## Working Notes

*Prose and verse are rhythmic-semantic structures; both are vehicles
for poetry. The twisting space where the two meet is like a path
which is often hard to find, variously rocky, earthy and grassy. Each
kind makes particular demands and endows particular qualities.*

***EASY KILL / TRAN*** *structures itself in paragraphs: significant
breaks come, not at the end of lines or sentences, but at the end of
paragraphs. Sub-structures are of variable length without there being
a strong base rhythm. It is laid out accordingly.*

*Thus, the decision is technical, no more, no less.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Twenty seven men,** slightly unformed, enter the building at the ground
floor. They move swiftly and smoothly, each minimizing use of space,
as coins will as they slide from production machines into
circulation.

The group splits apart, rolling down corridors, rising up stairwells.
Reason is not engaged; locks and bolts hold no one back. They are
ruthless, even in the way that they sustain themselves.

When they have finished, twenty five leave as they entered. Two are
carried on stretchers, observed by a photographer who will be injured
later; the film crew never make it home.

He walks loose-limbed, does not drink and eats rarely. His skin seems
beetroot-stained; his hair greys in slippery afternoon light.

Is that your key? he asks, but his mind's not on the answer. Calm
down, she says, but that's another conversation. The coffee\'s
beginning to boil over.

Charts on the wall hang loose on their drawing pins. He turns to sit
and subsides into the chair, yet stays as bunched and clustered to
himself as a primrose. He begins to read, slowly, mouthing some of
the words.

Gun emplacements fall apart. The cliff edges towards them. Roads
widen; building spreads; red ants extend across the bottom field; the
climbing rose gets rangy.

A woman makes a big noise, kissing her child; most of it's
pre-contact. The child responds with a startled pleasure yelp. A
drill bit cuts through steel. She rubs her nose against the child's
nose. Some moisture is transferred. I see it glisten as they pull
back from each other. All the colours of the rainbow, says the woman.

A glittering sphere swings with other reflected spheres below it,
doubling on the glittering surface of the wet floors, reflecting
against a wall. The spheres and their reflections merge.

Day's lights come on. The hall is well lit now. It\'s almost white.
Reflections make illusions of space, imaginary corridors between
darker reflections.

A bright empty day. Light from sea is brighter than light from rocks.
Both make it difficult to see. Steps come out of clouds. Something
which menaces hover... more than two things, remaining one thing, a
body with paws and emerging tongues. An almost-silvery watery day.

A flock of birds, the letters of a shout, rising from a farm, among
plants growing there, and form themselves into a line which they fly
along. The sound makes several indistinct words, which form
themselves variously into a scarecrow and a windmill.

The scarecrow waves its arms in the wind and the windmill turns,
speaking of something flying and something explosive and something
breaking and useful rolling downhill, an old wrecked car in a quarry,
a navigation aid, a broken sign on the headland, a set of tools
spilling from a dropped tool box. A piece of soft paper blows through
the complex.... The wind drops.

They are making this place their own, spreading their refuse! The
walls are large and solid; but the inscriptions are unreadable and
they find it hard to deduce purpose from the room structures -
defensive walls and none of the subsidiary signs of defensiveness,
contained areas and no utility to the containment. They think it is a
temple. A break in the walls as if from external damage or geological
disturbance; and, within that break, something that pulsed,
unrecognizable, almost thoroughly decayed, webs of fibres, doubling
of sight to no purpose and with no cause.

A flag of torn words, things said, a string of them tied in a
narrative that no one would or could believe, a verbal paling, a
piece of song in prison, a humming through boredom made bearable by
concentration; a flight of steps whose beginning and whose end has
been abandoned, excavated; carved into the steps, letters believed to
be contemporaneous with the steps, but not readable; a fence of
broken words, torn from library books and official buildings, on its
side, after violent wind; a series of shadows in the inner court;
shells falling.

A roll of bunting falls across steps and cascades open. Near the
bottom, it spreads out and the figure of a man forms. He rises from a
river and disintegrates. The river becomes slogans and the slogans
turn into the figure of a man. This image breaks in several places.

He looks into shadow, out of bright day, and sees black; a smell and
a scuttling come out; the words of the tune he had been singing on a
screen of temporary blindness; smiles form between words; loved faces
and feared faces take on the words. Behind him, someone is calling
smiles into his camera. These words too shelter in the dark place;
lights in the head die... The transformation ceases. It is still too
dark to see; the sight is fading, light from the bomb bay as it
opens; a city burning. It is black with no breath upon waters and no
thing flying over; not night because night had a beginning and will
have an end; not death because death flows out of living; not black,
the colour, because that has some amelioration, some grey suggestion
or a blueness so deep it does not seem blue; a silent black, loss of
words, sizeless whole; closing of eyes to pain before pain without
light filtered through eyelids, without memory of light; not any
colour; but absence of colour, and absence of a meaning to the word
colour, and absence of absence, because absence would imply a
potential presence, or the light which brings a knowledge of the
colour, absence of wave and wave length, absence of dimension,
absence of genitive relationship, absence of knowledge of
relationship; and absence of knowledge, a single tuple breaking as if
dead wood if it were to exist, if there were a place for it or a tree
to exist, from a tree without existence in the dark which has no
existence. Look away.

Blow backs through the headlights speckle the windscreen; a voice on
the radio nags; the road disappears into a point; someone goes over
the top and dives, only his hand sticking from the tumble into white,
and water spills on the hard surfaces which would have seemed smooth
and are now seen, unevenly, as the fall buckles and splashes from its
downward. Caverns open in the hardness while rivulets flow into them.
Dazzling blank spaces break out and then break. Surfaces seem to
merge under speedy water. Voices bunch together and grow thorns we
trip on.

Voices regulate themselves and march multi-legged. Avoid them. Film
runs in and out of sprockets, tearing and catching itself,
projecting, another film than the one expected and the one filmed.
Film as film, mutters the technician, sneering, as he joins broken
sections and there is little hope that anything will have changed -
except this copy of the film. He winds it backwards but the thing is
tumbled in its reel.

A water wheel turns double imaged in an unprecedented flow of water.
Several stage lights stutter. A flint on a lighter sparks briefly and
he blows smoke into the eyes of one trying to help him. Someone has
spilt motor oil and it's everywhere.

Leaves and red metal. A sheet of red metal, a field of green
leaves...

Words painted with yellow paint on sodden fencing wood, fallen
over...

Roots of a tree which has been uprooted, hanging over the hole it had
itself made, displaced, and cut through straight eighteen inches up
its trunk...

An old concrete platform towered over by flowering lupines...

A bus goes by...

A blue plastic crate...

At the top of the hill, several stories of reflecting glass throw
back the hill and sky valley in unexpectedly-shaped segments,
duplicating disarraying simultaneously...

A dovecote in slow process of falling down the side of a disused
railway embankment, collapsing as it does so. Paint flakes from it.
Water streaks it. Cobwebs fan out, catching and turning dim afternoon
light. Runnels of earth where the soil is washed away. Broken white
enamel, a matins bell, an upholstery armchair attracting flies in a
village car park. A flattened beer can rolls a little way across the
Aldwych in evening breeze. After a while it rolls not back but in a
new direction on a bus wind.

A man with a large beer gut and a cap over his eyes; a large black
key; an hysterical person between headlights; testicles and heads
hanging from butchers' hooks; a hole in perimeter fencing; warning
signs in empty corridors; a security guard exploding in gun fire; a
woman reaching for the moon; a bus turning in a circle, on and on; an
opportunity for metamorphosis; a clout hammer hard on a pair of
hands; cash; hard on; a body buried beneath a crumbling floor with
only its face showing; an unexpected fall; a shower of rain; a green
olive doused in olive oil; a stretch of silver sand!

A picture of a smiling woman, engineered to make her look younger
than she now is; a bar of chocolate; empty seats; a digital display
showing a binary code progression; a cave painting; a picture of a
tomb; a smiling robber; levels of pain; an army unit; false images,
including misleading images; row upon row upon row of a man calling,
making excessive claims in a high-pitched voice; blue water inside
words you've used; a poseur trying to organize a trip, invoking the
spirit of Columbus; two men rubbing their legs against each other's
warily, fingering knives; a period of blackness; there isn't much
truth in anything you say.

Panic in the rowboats - there's so much steam hardly any of them can
see what they are doing - and they speak frantically, aggressive, but
no one gets hurt. They're trying to get aboard a large model boat.

The sand is green and the sea yellow, all out of focus. He floats,
somehow, in the cave. His feet are not in the sea, most certainly;
but he cannot see his feet.

No sound of sea. Jazz piano played fast. A spider swings on a web. A
snail on a twig, dewdrops hanging from surrounding branches. Forest
takes green from the beach. Which is sea? No sensation. A bit of
forest is in focus. A forest with a yellow sky.

Light white dust pouring through a down-angled window in a thick
wall. A vast cello bowed by someone even vaster. She cannot see
across the room. It's far too far. All she can see is the cello and
a shadow of the player. Towards her feet, the curvature of the Earth
distorts her body's shape.

Two suitcases, wide open, sprawled across the living room floor,
clothing items and other personal things hanging out of them; a
vacuum cleaner cable, the vacuum cleaner tube turned over itself;
there's hardly any place to sit; carpet predominantly red and brown;
the people hardly real, as if remembered from a long while back;
murmur and mumble of their voices, less clear the more one
concentrates, less interesting the more one hears.

A galleon upon the sea at evening, the sky black, running into gold
and red, and then blue, as she looks across the hemisphere, a single
bird, gliding, high up; distance collapses as the light goes, the
whole fleet becomes a shadow and the shadow merges with the
atmosphere between, called darkness; a light is on at the vanity
table; a breeze lifts the curtains; the wallpaper gleams in the
indirect light, a cloying smell of scent I can't quite place, the
breath of someone.

A black and white photograph lying semi-crumpled on the floor picked
out in white torch light; bottom of a chest of drawers, a white strap
hanging down; a man hanging from a ceiling beginning to crack with
the weight.

A green yellow blue parrot painting itself intermittently and
cleaning its toes in a room got up in Turkish style; a video camera
records events; sometimes the parrot consults notes and sometimes it
seems to improvise; a potted fern sways as if in a breeze; the video
camera hardens; there is a smell of damp; muffled voices at a
distance.

Freight yards stretch to the horizon; trains come here from all nodes
on the Earth's surface.

Bright light illuminates the public house opposite; but it is not the
light of day, rather a video screen of bright colours.

A trolley, high-sided, gloss black, building itself, two uprights
standing upright, spinning round the chassis and assembling in a
street of plane trees; some beggars, hands behind their backs, tied
together, heaped over a tarpaulin at the side of the bright street,
watched by a policeman who spits at them; the harsh wind blows into
them; gloves with the fingers torn out; the police sergeant is trying
to talk sense but he cannot make it; a man with a smart suit is
holding up a framed mirror around and about which he plays find the
lady; his suit is getting grubby; the wind up gramophone is slowing
down; no one is paying any attention to anything; a woman rocks a
marionette in a pushchair; the marionette is counting money; a child
stamps in a puddle; in the puddle one sees a reflection of the moon;
from the moon the Earth might look beautiful.

Everyone stands in the raked seating and the coffin is wheeled slowly
out of the hall to where, in the forest, someone has been
demonstrating what a railroad looks like, using twigs placed
parallel; a head is rolled down the tracks, bits of the throat still
attached to it trailing, coagulating blood running out, the terrified
face aware; it passes between my feet.

Almost the entire body, distorted towards the top or dwindling from
head to foot, a kind of homunculus, demonstrating a fish eye effect,
follows its head without assistance. She stays calm, the body,
sliding down this stupidly inadequate image; friction stops her; she
begins to deteriorate and, as her elements separate, rage takes her;
she bangs her hands upon the ground, she shakes and throws a silent
tantrum, collapses into leaves from the bottom of a forest; nearby a
bonfire has been started.

A dark-skinned woman got up like a comic book sorceress brings down
her arm in a line towards people who have transgressed. They fall
into pieces, broken mannequins, and crumble into mouldy chocolate
among strands of tissue paper.

A scorpion spins on a sandy floor, chasing its own tail.

Blackness crystallizes out of fog moving forwards. They track ahead
of it, seventy, eighty miles per hour, shaded headlights, which drop
as the car transforms, layer below layer, concertinalike, to a row of
tumbling stacking chairs, in the very first instant of the tumble,
eyes being shot from their sockets, bulbs and lampholders from
lampshades, guts from torn bodies, presents dropped from Christmas
stockings; and it begins to lumber like an early attempt to
demonstrate the reality of the skeletons of giant animals; the
road's been lost for ever; and the voice, not just falsely jocular,
but sounding false as it imitates a falsely jocular voice, speaks:
you turn upon your own centre like a paper spill.

A male and a female walk together. He gestures to two male children
following obediently, throws a scarf counterclockwise around her neck
and moves forward striding high, features blotted out to protect the
guilty; the film merges with and is taken over by a second film quite
unrelated; the street is ended violently by cobbled nineteen
nineties' chic; a man walks a woman in a wheel chair up the centre
of the street which ends at a sort of knuckle joint, asserting thus a
vortex of cobble stones trying to force one away from further
progress, cut into a portrait of a monstrous wide-armed Christ above
a city and thence into a pasty white sun hanging in a mist; a silver
screw dropping through a Victorian municipal glass roof.

A foam cut out angel fights a cat; the cat's cut out, aggressive,
back bent to give it power; the angel, hides within her string bag,
the one expression she has appropriate because so ambiguous, a
measure of concern, a measure of dismay, a measure of remoteness.

A man sucking a sweet while he speaks apparently affably; an old man
scratching his head, dandruff rising.

Dear Laird:

Loved "The Avenue" and the way that it is laid out so interactively aids its metaphor, its narrative. Suits your work. I think it would be interesting for you to expand this, really think about ways to use the medium, work perhaps with some animated texts (if that sort of thing interests you at all) -- not that "dude, it's the future," but more like your work speaks about the fragility and transitory nature of reality and perception and I think so much of the experience of this medium mirrors that, is about that, so to have the experiential elements mirror your texts would be powerful, at least I think.

"Penelope work of forgetting?" I recently started reading a book called "The User Illusion" where it states that in computer informational theory it is hypothesized that the lion's share of informational capacity it having to rid the system of the old bad information before inputting the new information. Most of the "work" of thought is in the forgetting.

Also Bill Viola's piece at the Whitney where the oz-like loudspeaker fills the room with:

| the one who...
| the one who...
| the one who...
| the one who...

endlessly cycling ending each line of the mantra with
a different verb each time mirrored itself by a spinning
mirror - shifting light and perspective around the room of
stationary people observing this shifting point of view,
readers in some respect

"We live in an age of errata, of misinformation, of
disinformation, of hoax;"

Is this true or not true, seems to me the question. Working on
the internet, it seem like there is a pressure towards an
economy of increasing sincerity, frankness, as the customer
demands the facts delivered to him/her in personalized ways.
So the rhetoric is an experience framed with increasing
exactitude on what the customer not only says, but does, wants
in all the situations of his/her life. So it's almost as if
a current of information is existing beneath an old layer of
disinformation eroding it. Beneath the supposed clarity of
information are the hard facts of economic injustice,
technological imbalances, increasing willingness to look the
other way if it benefits the economy, co-opting the energy and
originality of the younger generation into the corporate
machine. But narrative is surely the guiding principle of the
dream of clarity that floats the information bubble, filled
with mysterious air. The metaphors of software are the
simplest or the most fundamental, "soft" + "ware" "micro"
+ "soft" poetry is programming fitted with a friendly masque
- the programmers, the passionate ones, have such
a romanticism about their code and the beauty of it, the way
it can be understood and built upon by future coders, that
makes one wonder if the efficacy of poetry to the classic age
where it was the primary communicator of civilization has now
shifted to the coder, who is fast becoming the primary
visionary and bearer of the fabric of civilization.

Dear Dan,



Where I work one of the things it is impossible to circumvent is this question of imbalance you bring up -- and while what makes .com headlines is the technology imbalance -- what we are still really talking about is reliable access to food, shelter and water, and some kind of immediate protection/relief from war, natural disaster and AIDS. I love the idea of a current of information running under/over/alongside the established trickster channels (cataracts a la aol/timewarner), and the narrative element of all these fresh tributaries, but fear that frankness will be a long, long while in reaching those perhaps most in need of it. For while the customer sounds his/her clarion call for straight talk out across a network that is growing denser much more quickly than it is growing wider, the big tv networks still run the stories that work for them and their advertisers, and in the meantime run viagra ads next to stories on the conditions in Andean salt mines.

Of course, to change tack, if we want to discuss stunted networks we can take up the topic of non-mainstream, challenging, slightly difficult to categorize, prose fiction -- I'd love to hear some thoughts on where the hell all the publishers have gone. It's a curious circumstance, and testament to a lot of hard work, that beautiful, beleaguered poetry seems to be thriving (with terrific outlets galore), while it is often an extraordinary battle to get a non-mainstream prose work into book form (e.g., and this is reaching back a little, David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress, which I mention in "The Avenue" and which is an extraordinary work, got 50 plus smacks in the face before being picked up by Dalkey -- to whose efforts we owe the availability of so many great works). There are paradigm breakers out there -- Ben Marcus is probably one, as is Pamela Lu and certainly W.G. Sebald -- but I suspect that a fair number of 'narrativity' minded prose fiction practicioners have run over and over again into any variety of walls. N.D. has trimmed way back and turned its prose eyes Europe-ward. Sun & Moon seems to be accesible only through their contest. Dalkey does mainly (or only) reprints these days. Coffee House does great things but can only extend so far. Likewise Burning Deck. Etc.

But, in the meantime (and I'm out of time), what I really wanted to say was thanks for 'taking on' what I wrote -- so often these things just 'vanish', much like Penelope's errant threads, and those emails I sometimes lose, into the mysterious air -- Laird

I wanted to add, as a postscript to my wacky change in direction (I'd been at work for about 11 hours), that Lydia Davis's work burns a pretty damn big beacon for me. An example of someone who has, for years, written extraordinary (no other word for it) prose that I look to over and over again. She has a fantastic 'little' piece in the latest issue of McSweeney's and a terrific series in the Fall 99 issue of Bomb.

So "narrativity!?!" : on the cusp of subjectivity and objectivity? But more than lip. Definitely animal. It can be but does it have to be kept on a "A chain of telling..."? (per Trevor Joyce)? As Laird Hunt whispered in the hyperwings "The work is in the reader and the reader is in the world." Protein.

Words enter my head sequentially and the sequence matters. But once they've all accumulated in my head, hey, it's all simultaneous. Like history. I guess that's what a clue is-- something that only makes sense in the context of the whole thing (whatever that is).

 Now that the story is dead, I mourn for it the way a killer mourns the man he's hit with his old car. There is a moment of glory when that man lifts his charred leg before passing, and I feel responsible, hence excited. As a child, I played with various types of knives and enjoyed the commercials of men sawing nails with strong knives. This then, like the car, is our tool. I am a hammerer and a Fascist. Yes, although I am not popular or even known, I feel strongly that although stories are dead, their shadows remain like some kind of fallout. Remember Dawn of the Dead? "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth." Although a bit understated, I feel this way about that man I hit with my car. He has a story. He was born Gyorgy, changed his name for unknow reasons, worked as a carpenter, had two retarded children. I killed him. But even though I tried, I didn't kill his story. As I live out my sentence, I must remember that.

Ann Bogle and Mark Wallace (NOTHING HAPPENED AND BESIDES I WASN'T THERE, TELLING IT SLANT)are planning to co-edit a volume of essays on innovative writing practice, called PROSETICS, to include essays about fiction and prose form. Our emphasis will be on practice rather than on theory, and with that in mind, we will also welcome writing about writing that does not fall under the rubric "essay." We will consider as-yet unpublished work as well as reprints. Send notes of interest to Ann Bogle at AMBogle@aol.com.

Ann Bogle's short stories have been published in THE QUARTERLY, FICTION INTERNATIONAL, GULF COAST, and WASHINGTON REVIEW ("My Crush on Daniel Ortega"). Her mixed-genre prose work has been anthologized in NEUROMANTIC FICTION, a Black Ice Anthology (excerpts, "This Was Called War At One Time"), 2001. Fourteen of her prose poems, XAM: Paragraph Series, will be issued by Xexoxial Endarchy fall 2001.

much of this is the name.


an effect of filigree overlooked.


checked still was the place designed.


center with (is) fiction.


and who cost us the theme?


"Let's monologue!"


"Is this 'democratic' enough?"


Possession is 9/10th of Precision.


narrativity is colorless and odorless.


the wonders seen almost second-hand.


the sequence knew when to switch off...

FIRST MISSIVE FROM VIRGINIA

dear ....here is first contact from ur old new
Virginia.....
when you wrote the last poem i give it a very
serious thought....and I figured it out ....i mean my
quite loneliness ......cuz i start to blame my self
.....but....should I?!?!?!?...am not giving any excuse
here....but....let's stop for a while ...let's stop the
time and the movement all around me...and to have a
look ..!!!.....let me convince my self of my existence.....
now am really alone...no one is here but me...oh..ok.....
am I living with them or they are living with me ??? who
needs who??? do i need them to tell me how great ...and brilliant and how beautiful I am??? or they need me to tell them how happy I am cuz they all around me, and that am nothing without them ??? wait....wait..... am i nothing without them really?????? OH my GOD whom am facing here???? me or them???.

am facing my suffering thoughts....my weakness...my sensitive Formosa....my lying promises....am facing every thing leads me to nowhere...to nothing....there is no direction to my thoughts or my lucky pennies ....and i don't know the page I'm walking in !!!! am i really alone or there is others with me ????? for how long do u think this strong wind will last?? can i hang up with my weakness.....and my small wings???? what do i need to face it? or to get over it ?.......why i don't just let it take me to its waves.......................
but u know ...no matter how hard you try to
keep my soul around it will never survive....now I realize that moving away from words can be very painful and difficult, still i assume that...... i don't know if i have enough generosity to forgive my self for its inability to understand my life....i really don't know .
am sorry jeff really i am (i said sorry more than i
said mum) what can i say??? and this is why am writing to you .....maybe cuz I'm ceaseless.....

ROT SANDAL: Listen to this one. A man, his wife, and his daughter walk into a desert, right? They wander around, they're lost, and they're starving. The wife offers herself up as food, ok?, but the guy says no, he'll be the meal.
But the woman says no, too. They reason that being a single parent is no way to go at things. So they eat the kid.

THIMBLE PINCH: They're stupid. They shudda ate a lizard or something.

ROT SANDAL: There are no ---

THIMBLE PINCH: There ARE lizards in the desert. There are lizards everywhere, except the moon.

Furiously plotting to know what you're talking about, I went to see the
Bishop with a fistful of cloth. The villagers had all returned to their
homes. If you're all right, I am what they say I am. If not, their poems
become mud and rain and tearing wind. Watch these gauges and let me know if
anything goes wrong, OK? That old guy must be one of the translators.
Individuals married and had children at random.

Their poems are as mud and rain and tearing wind. I'm trying to see what is
happening with the roiling mass o' bodies. Watch these gauges and let me

recognized me despite my disguise. Something haunts her grey stooped figure
from the bones outward. If you're all right, I am what they say I am.

With thanks to all the editors of the Narrativity magazine.
I have read Katy Acker's article "Killers" and I am very interested to translate this article to Persian (Farsi).
To do so, I would be very pleased if you would gracefully help me on achieving this

I find much of this writing on Narrative here interesting, but some of the ideations are becoming hackneyed at this point (for instance, Bellamy's opining on shock lit and pop assimilations). I have to agree with Bok's assessment of the ultimate literary worth (and taste) of many of the Oulip(i)an end-products...even though it feels like giddy fun when it's liberating us...to what end if the penchant is ultimately for received forms/taste or taming stochastic products into regulated modes of meaning-production? More of the "post-interesting," to quote a very well-spoken novelist? I also find the bitchiness of many of the writers tiring....so threatened by mainstream writers b/c of their "success" and audience appreciation....knocking the writers, knocking the audience(s)...the poor benighted audiences who so clearly WOULD want the much hipper hominy these writers are purveying....if ONLY they could be segregated into force-feeding pens in intellectual concentration camps for at least four or preferably eight years...preferably in california....and most tiring of all is the obsessive-compulsive allusions to "revolutions" (the ultimate tiresomeness of the avant-garde anywhere) these blindingly new embodiments of fiction will bring us...why don't they just admit they're after newer/rarer forms of textual pleasure...it's as simple as that, isn't it? ("pomo-lit is a badly aimed pomo-doro"--ghost of jack spicer on venice beach boardwalk, aug. 17, 2003) But maybe the books by some of these galling people--i HAVE enjoyed books by gluck, bellamy & killian among others here--are more interesting than their byzantine, cappuccino-scented theories...which are sometimes enlivening....if nothing else, these essays are rich in the anecdotal and the references to works worth seeking out...and some of these writers (thank bog) are painfully honest about how writing mystifies them...like renee gladman.....there one gets a sense of how the author stays interested...one more infinite game in life...if we only had the finite ones, suicide would undoubtedly be more common than it is among the "writing classes"...and i guess we all know their curse--regrettably "it ain't drink"--if we've read this issue...

I recently happenstanced upon Narrativity, and it seems an innovative, essential journal. As a poet, writer, and sometimes (when they'll have me) teacher of expository writing, I increasingly crave creative exchange & interchange of ideas.

I'd like to meet local writers who blur the borders between poetry and prose, and who challenge what seems an often stagnant notion of creative writing.

Here we reoccur through wordlines. Stumbling thoughtgutteral


The rain e rases our normal barriers. I have been speaking all of this time. The quiet static of days like this is akin to radio waves unclearly received, through it (this time) my message to you.


Like reading through waterfall static air, these words convey this message.

Living through art. Bound to each other in this
communication.
We produce language to transmit our thoughts, evading inevitables. We speak to lie and to hope. Forget everything.

         (narrative and otherwise)

Vancouver

Editors:

Very interesting material here.

I am interested in the manner in which "desire" (as such) is textually mediated through narrative in a variety of forms. The convergence of "narrative" and "rhetoric" is also of interest--in terms of postmodernism, postcolonalism (re: Edward Said's, Culture and Imperialism) as well as in terms of cinema studies and, in a negative sense, the politics of exclusion.

Thank you for all of your hard work and for making this material available to interested readers.
