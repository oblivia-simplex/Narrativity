| Soaring and diving with the aquarium sharks and casting another       |
| shadow half imitation and half prebirth. Drinking of this aquarium    |
| water tincture and thereby knowing something happened. Thus reaching  |
| for the dictionary. Inadequacy\'s tablet, one nervous twitch before   |
| story\'s wish to subtract by including too many particulars. Such     |
| soft wax of impression. A highly sophisticated selection of pattern   |
| for which, in the past, they had only the word \"memory.\" In         |
| Intelexa there is a saying, \"Obfuscate so that the windshield\'s     |
| film will clearly wash over you.\" This is not religious maxim but    |
| the slay of time\'s desire to organize you into a bonsai beyond       |
| recall.                                                               |
