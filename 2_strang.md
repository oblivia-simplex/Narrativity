| **On Narrative:**
|
| *3:28am*
|
| The temporal element of narrative humanizes, introducing history,
| biography and, therefore, mortality; as time is presenced, so is
| humanity and, so then, is the passing of time. What are the
| implications for the conceptualization of human history if, through
| temporality, pronouns become subjective and indeterminate, if
| temporal elements in narrative are disjoined or occur simultaneously?
| What are the implications if we are seduced by narrative, by the
| promise of passing time (in an eroticized dance with death), and are
| not led toward syllogism and deduction but discover, instead,
| induction, investigation, participation?
|
| Aaron Shurin, in \"Narrativity,\" proposes that \"writing might use
| narrative without succumbing to its hegemonic orders of linear
| development, unity of time/tense-and apart from the modernist
| reconstructing modes of memory and dream. A prose whose paragraphic
| groupings themselves might be based on measure, whose higher
| integrations might be thematic or associational rather than
| developmental.\"
|
| When liberated from plodding development, can narrative, loaded with
| its historical implications, move us away from the discrete series
| and veer toward witness, philosophy, discovery?

|
| *2:48am*
|
| Turn your face toward the back seat. Walk up the stairs to an
| apartment set in stone. Listen to the parking lot below. A man lies
| on the outside of a fence, exhaling. This is the view of others\'
| rooftops, making them into little pieces of pie. Rows of fluorescent
| tubes. On the islands of a nearly drained sea, turtles lie exposed
| and cracked roots tremble in a particularly strong wind. The mail is
| delivered with surprising accuracy down the storm drain. You\'re
| alarmed by the presence of gunmen in your hotel room.
|
| *2:49am*
|
| A policeman on the street looks through layers of glass. A very dead
| thing. Motion toward the approaching car. Now you would like to leave
| by way of the great hall. Strange ways and the lack of knowledge of
| local customs prevent you from negotiating stillness. Manage nothing.
| Reptile.
|
| *4:58am*
|
| Lying on the night flattened. Maps of territory barely existent.
| Pools cover the floor. A single drip from the middle of the air. You
| think this might be the kingfisher. Two figures in the middle of the
| room-translucent. Thin warmth of blue light in a very small town. As
| padding footsteps structure the quiet, a man looks from the top of a
| house. They lie in a casual circle sleeping on the ocean floor.
|
| 
|
| *4:59am*
|
| He pats his suit pocket, fingers the traveler\'s checks in his shoes.
| Trucks begin to unload themselves all around. Drop off to sleep. Many
| floors up the windows are missing. Entry is enclosed. Water continues
| to drip.
|
| *3:29am*
|
| Walk below the surface and pick at the matrix of possibilities.
| Shifting focus, a spray of bubbles through water, padded air on the
| ceiling. A bent neck, S shaped, springs forward when needed, weeding
| out the sick and the old.
|
| *5:13am*
|
| Synapse. The kingfisher hovers. Get together. A crush of grace. The
| beats between are short. A real taste. A hand\'s distance from the
| floor. Wings over balconies, through glass. On the inside of the
| skin, very sweet and it becomes petrified.
|
| *2:16am*
|
| A car brings someone to this very corner. The greatest are able to
| brace themselves, to support a moving supply. This too is style, you
| think. Behind you in the car is a man. Turn around quickly to find
| the shell of a turtle. You tremble at the lack of knowledge, at the
| blue light. You\'re alarmed now by the lack of presence.
|
| *4:22pm*
|
| Click of ribs. Drone, repeat. Footbridge. Highway. Landing zone
| agenda. Corrective maneuvers. Unassailable.
|
| *6:12am*
|
| Dawn begins below the floor, sends razors, slits, leaves an overall
| impression. You concentrate on the phenomenon. The television
| presents you with a flat grey surface. Leave marks on the sandbar.
| Retract yourself as the tide rises. Deactivated bleakness. Wiggle
| your fingers as complexities weave into numb certainty. A fin is
| cutting through, toward equilibrium. Paths intersect. A car door
| opens. Apartments. Surprisingly nimble. Walk around inside. Retract.
|
| *2:59pm*
|
| Somnambulence. Funicular shoes. The growth rate is a recursive
| soliloquy. Some tetrahedral antipathy. Total shadow. Halitosis gloss.
|
| *5:55am*
|
| Unscathed, a memoir progressively installed. Move across the field of
| vision. Turn ash piles. Bristle with teeth. Bone worms make their
| paths. Spillover highway fanned out. Contrite motive. Recount sobs.
| Astonished circuits in a coma. Damp faces. The nerve protectants.
|
| *2:12am*
|
| Open the door onto the waves. Drop beneath tension to the street.
| Find your way along in the dark, fingering shells. Cling to a ledge,
| creating shelter, always watching what hovers, what makes you burrow
| in wet soil. The ceiling is glass. Peering from above. Under the
| gaze, crawl about your business. A great neck dips, picks morsels
| from below. At any moment. In the back seat of the car, in the
| security of a bed, on the street, beneath the surface, on a small
| island, in the bones.
