| *From* **Eros The Bittersweet**, by Anne Carson
|
| \". . . Whenever passion seems within reach, *aidos* falls like a
| veil. . . . This *aidos* is the archaic ethic of \'shamefastness\'. .
| . . Ahprodite is the divinity in charge of the perversities of
| *aidos* within the novel. She is the chief designer and chief
| subverter of the story\'s changing triangles, both patron and enemy,
| inspiring with a passion strong enough to resist all the temptations
| that she herself proceeds to hurl against it. . . . Aphrodite\'s role
| in novels is an ambivalent, not to say paradoxical, one like the role
| of Eros in archaic poetry.\" Eros, p. 79-80
|
| \[Carson\'s Greeks lined up Eros versus \'shamefastness,\' which I
| contemporaneously interpret not as \'chastity\' but as \'cover-up\';
| class has entered discourse: shame is private and social (Scott)\]
|
| 
| From **The Shell and the Kernel** (Vol. 1) by Nicholas Abraham and
| Maria Torok
|
| . . . What haunts are not the dead, but the gaps left within us by
| the secrets of others . . .
| . . . It is reasonable to maintain that the \'phantom effect\'
| progressively fades during its transmission from one generation to
| the next and that, finally, it disappears. Yet, this is not at all
| the case when shared or complementary phantoms find a way of being
| established as social practices along the lines of *staged words* . .
| . To stage a word, whether metaphorically, as an alloseme, or as a
| cryptonym-constitutes an attempt at exorcism, an attempt, that is, to
| relieve the unconscious by placing the effects of the phantom in the
| social realm.
| . . . The phantom\'s periodic and compulsive return lies beyond the
| scope of symptom formation in the sense of a return of the repressed;
| it works like a ventriloquist, like a stranger within the subject\'s
| own mental topography. The imaginings issuing from the presence of a
| stranger have nothing to do with fantasy strictly speaking. They
| neither preserve a topgraphical status quo nor announce a shift in
| it. Instead, by their gratuitousness in relation to the subject, they
| create the impression of surrealistic flights of fancy or of
| oulipo-like verbal feats.
|
| \[I like to think of the phantom dressed up in a cloak studded with
| the latest consumer items, on his way to the zoo. I like the play
| between contiguity and disjunction implied by attempting to converse
| with the unspeakable. This makes strange sentences that swing
| \"both\" ways, dialoguing with both the uncanny and the social: a
| rhetorical edge is added to poetic thinking. (Scott)\]
| 
| *From* **Zoo or Letters Not About Love** by Viktor Shklovsky
|
| . . .She loved me like her own daughter. When I was two months old,
| she fed me cabbage soups and once she managed to poison me by gorging
| herself on the pits from the cherry preserves that were being made at
| our summer cottage. When I grew up, she came to see me, always with
| presents; she remained standing and spoke to me in the formal way;
| then, when everyone left, she sat down to drink tea with me and used
| the familiar form . When I became an adult, I began to understand her
| cheerful disposition: \'My mistress lives with another woman; it\'s
| beyond me-just like nuns!\' And she\'d roar with laughter\--. . . She
| had a special smell, like her wooden trunk when she lifted the lid:
| calico and apples. A tlted nose, knowing eyes. . .
| \"One time she was working in a very rich household. The house was
| robbed. . .
| Papa asked her: \'And where were you when the house was robbed?\'
| \'At the Novo-Devichy Convent visiting a nun.\'
| \'Well, then, tell them and they\'ll let you go.\'
| \'What? And get a nun mixed up in such business, master!\'
| So she didn\'t say a word, but sat in prison until the thieves were
| found and she was released.
| Then, after the revolution, Mama tried to persuade her to go vote,
| but she said that after that business with the silver spoons, she
| wouldn\'t go near the police station for love or money.
|
| \[This passage, though \"authored\" by Sklovsky, is actually by Elsa
| Triolet, Shklovsky\'s beloved at the time. He integrated her letters
| into his own fiction. I had intended to quote Shklovsky; whose manner
| of stringing together seemingly cut-up prose lines to effect
| narrative \'continuity\' is exemplary. Not only shame, but also
| authorship, get partly buried here. (Scott)\]

| 
| From Lyn Hejinian\'s Introduction to Jena Osman\'s **Character**
|
| Performance requires the person who is the actor (i.e. already a
| character) to be in character, and this, in turn, cannot occur
| without performance. This produces not a tautology (\"performance
| requires performance\") but a bifurcation-character occurring as a
| performance in and of itself; or, as Osman says (in \"The Figural
| Cabinet\"), \"the taking place is double.\"
| Such double-mindedness, which is to say this \'self\'conscious, is
| central to Brechtian theater; it forms the basis on which alterities
| can come into (the) play. It is characteristic, too, of everyone who
| is forced into identity-consciousness, as W.E.B. Du Bois pointed out
| long ago in The Souls of Black Folk, a work which itself has been
| described (by Houston Baker) as a \"cultural performance.\" More
| recently, the notion that \"identity\" is itself performative has
| been greatly elaborated by theorists such as Judith Butler.
| Identity-the sense of difference that belongs to one\'s
| self-sameness-is itself \"character,\" something that \"takes
| place.\" This means both that it is an occurrence or event-it
| happens-and that it involves taking up a position among others (as
| might be indicated by stage directions: *Enter Woman, wearing a hat,*
| etc.)
|
| 
| From \"Not All Halfbreed Mothers\" in **I Knew Two Métis Women**, by
| Greg Scofield
|
| Not all halfbreed mothers
| wear cowboy shirts or hats,
| flowers behind their ears or
| moccasins sent from up north.
|
| Not all halfbreed mothers
| read *The Star, The Enqurer,
| The Tibetan Book of the Dead*
| or Edgar Cayce,
| know the Lady of Shalott
| like she was a best friend
| or sister.
|
| .............................
|
| Not all halfbreed mothers
| speak like a dictionary
| or Cree hymn book,
| . . . . . . . . . . .
|
| Not all halfbreed mothers
|
| drink
|
| red rose, blue ribbon,
| Kelowna Red, Labatt\'s Blue.
