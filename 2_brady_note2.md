| **NOTES:**                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| ^2^ Once upon a time, you were expected here, and when you didn\'t    |
| show, a place was set for someone who looked more or less unlike you. |
| You are sure to congratulate yourself for having caught me in this    |
| situation, making it up as I go along, but no matter, my aim\'s to    |
| bend all light into reflection, and so I have pre-empted your         |
| discovery of this point of fact. *In this strange phase of love the   |
| personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that  |
| the curiosity which you now feel stirring inside you with regard to   |
| the smallest details of my daily life, is the same thirst for         |
| knowledge with which I once studied history.* You have knocked a hole |
| in someone\'s wall and now there is nothing to do but look through,   |
| even as you realize that here is not the character for whom you       |
| looked, but perhaps a near relation, a time perhaps a bit early for   |
| your arrival, in which a beakless old waterbird wanders in circles    |
| over a threadbare carpet, casting terrifying shadows out onto the     |
| sidewalk as its circuit passes and repasses the lamp to which one of  |
| its webbed feet is tied by a length of packing twine that shortens    |
| inexorably with each revolution. Perhaps it has been a long time      |
| since you made any further holes, any perforations in the             |
| thick-napped paper that covers the interior walls of such a scene,    |
| simulating an all-encompassing sky which wraps itself around the      |
| outside of a train of events you were only moments ago riding as a    |
| casually interested commuter toward some other destination            |
| entirely---a long time, then, since you were a child, shooting at     |
| every hint of movement with a pellet gun by the shore of the          |
| artificial lake behind your father\'s rental duplex, knocking holes   |
| in beaks of birds to create the asymmetry out of which a story might  |
| take flight, *but in this case the mind, merely by recalling the      |
| pain, created it afresh,* lifting \"that of which we cannot speak\"   |
| into a chiaroscuro of yellow lamplight swirling down a drain into     |
| darkness as warm showers fell upon you from the hidden nozzle of      |
| theatrical night.                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| \"Tell me everything you saw, and what you think it means,\"          |
| stage-whispers Grace Kelly in the fascinated hush that cuts off the   |
| supply of light, her absent presence in this vignette responding to   |
| your recitation, which takes up each sentence in the discarded papers |
| blowing around against the all-encompassing sky and makes of it an    |
| opening whose dimensions are given in the aperture of the vocative    |
| \"O.\" Framed thus in the round zoom lens of surveillance, do you now |
| see the dashing figure you cut from afar brought into the tightest    |
| close-up, made ugly and atomic?                                       |
|                                                                       |
